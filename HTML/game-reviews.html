                                        <span>Cloudy with a chance of mead halls : The weather’s as bad as ever, but this smart, inventive and witty open-world game is a veritable Viking feast of adventure</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s been a wild ride this year, but you can always rely on Assassin’s Creed to lighten the mood. Let’s see what those zany historians at Ubisoft have cooked up for us in the excitingly named Assassin’s Creed Valhalla … Peterborough, is it? Norwich in the dark ages?
                                        I have nothing against our beautiful cathedral cities, rolling plains and park-and-ride services, but after 12 months of Brexit, Covid-19 and forest fires, plus the cancellation of the Eurovision song contest, I was hoping for something a little less Tough Mudder from this giddy, quasi-historical, action-adventure series, which previously had us gallivanting around Atlantis.
                                        </br></br>
                                        For the first few hours, you’re thrown into the icy political drama of ninth-century Norway, where Viking warrior Eivor runs around snow-blasted islands having stern conversations about the future of her clan. (You can play as a male or female version of Eivor, or have the game swap between them at intervals. I went with female Eivor.) This extended prologue plays out a bit like a Scandi Phantom Menace, and, after a while, Eivor and her brother Sigurd give up and decide to build a new life in England. It’s for the best.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Everything improves when you get to England (apart from the weather). Eivor and Sigurd establish the settlement of Ravensthorpe, then strike out into Mercia, East Anglia and beyond to forge alliances. Inevitably, this means riding around picturesque countryside (or sailing down rivers in your longship), solving people’s problems, collecting loot, and climbing churches, cliffs and Roman ruins.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssrNcwxALS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class=“video-2”></iframe>
                                        Ancient Egypt and Greece were easy to enjoy, whether you were tunnelling under the Sphinx or hanging from the chiselled penis of a Zeus statue, so the dark ages have their work cut out here. But, while this vast playground is less showy, it soon starts to feel more rarefied. Points of interest on your map are intriguing – a locked building that must be clawed open with a bit of lateral thinking, a man selling an elixir that promises instant wealth, or a piece of cloth that happens to be wafting above a parkour obstacle course. I’ve got used to auto-piloting around vast, open-world games tidying up icons on the map, but this feels more like exploring again. There’s repetition, sure, but also novelty.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/assassins-creed-valhalla-promo1.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed : Valhalla Promo Photo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        There are plenty of little villages to ransack, but these are now treated as Viking raids, where you beach your longship in the mud, blow your horn, and set off to do some pillaging. Fighting people hand-to-hand is the usual mix of dodges and parries, but there are nice additions such as dual-wielding that alter the rhythm of combat. There are ludicrous numbers of special attacks to unlock and add to your repertoire, and these are now tied to exploration as well as levelling up, which is a neat change. It’s harder to hide in bushes, marking enemies before silently dispatching them, but it’s a testament to the strength of this new approach to fighting that I forgot about that fairly quickly.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/assassins-creed-valhalla-promo2.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed : Valhalla Promo Photo" class="feature-two-promo">
                                        While the game sends you far and wide, the spoils of battle are most useful back home in Ravensthorpe. Reminiscent of Assassin’s Creed II’s beloved Monteriggioni, here you can build a blacksmith’s, a Hidden Ones assassins bureau, a hunting lodge, a Gregg’s and plenty more. (OK, maybe not the Gregg’s.) New buildings and settlers allow you to do new things out in the world, and Ravensthorpe is also where you turn in collectibles for rewards. There are a lot of decent quests to pick up here from friends and travellers, and as usual it’s the cranks and weirdos who make for the best fun.
                                        Eventually, I wandered back on to the critical path and started doing story missions. My litmus test for open-world story missions is whether I pull out my phone whenever a cinematic begins, and I certainly did with this game. Eivor is likable enough and the story of her Raven clan is full of twists and turns, but we’ve been on this kind of journey a bunch of times already. If you want a Norse mythology game with real heart, play the latest God of War.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Never mind the stuff you watch – it’s the things you end up doing in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla that are most compelling. At one point you’re told to identify a traitor in the ranks, so I steeled myself to run between map markers and watch bad acting, but instead found myself sleuthing around Cambridgeshire, interrogating people and checking alibis. At one stage, my wife walked in and asked me what I was doing. “I’m looking for a yellow boat! Help me find the yellow boat!” I imagine it makes a nice change from seeing me doomscroll on the couch.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Assassin’s Creed Valhalla takes a while to get going, but don’t be disheartened by its mirthless opening, because the smart, inventive and witty open-world game you’re hoping for is lurking somewhere over those gloomy hills and dales. Can we have our next assassin holiday somewhere sunny again though, please, Ubisoft?

                                        <span>I have mixed feelings about Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and frankly I’m not at all happy with how Activision has handled the transition from Modern Warfare to Black Ops Cold War in terms of the two games’ integration into Warzone.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        I’ve waited some time to write this review, simply because you really can’t judge a game like Call Of Duty based on how it plays on launch week. Historically, Activision has waited several weeks after the latest entry’s release to populate its micro-transaction shop. Reviewing a game before micro-transactions are live is a precarious proposition.
                                        But now much has changed. Starting with Modern Warfare in 2019, not only were map packs removed as DLC and replaced with free maps and a seasonal battle pass, the games dispensed with loot boxes entirely and adopted an Item Shop similar to Fortnite, selling only cosmetics and weapon blueprints (which, to be fair, are questionably pay-to-win in nature).
                                        </br></br>
                                        Still, how do you review a game that hasn’t even launched its first season, that hasn’t fully integrated into the free-to-play Battle Royale mode, Warzone yet? You can’t, I’d argue. It’s not the complete game yet.
                                        In this review I’ll discuss the Cold War campaign, multiplayer, integration into Warzone and Season 1 content as a barometer for future seasonal content. I will not discuss Zombies mode as I don’t really play that mode and don’t feel comfortable reviewing it. I’ve never enjoyed Zombies modes in the past and I don’t expect that to change now. In interest of fairness, I will leave that aside.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Of further note, I’ve played this game on both PC and PS5 (I received a PC review code but purchased the PS5 version of the game). It runs great—with some caveats—on both PC and console. Graphically, the PC version is superior but not enough to truly matter to anyone but the most graphics-obsessed gamers. Frankly, while I’m in the middle of a gunfight I don’t have a ton of time to pay attention to graphics. That being said, there’s no doubt that a good gaming PC running modern hardware (I have an RTX 3080 in mine) makes for a much richer campaign experience. Ray-tracing, DLSS, and all the other bells and whistles really do add to the experience.
                                        In any case, we’ll start with …

                                        <span>The Campaign</span></br>
                                        I really enjoyed the Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War campaign. This I can say without equivocation. It’s a solid, exciting campaign with some interesting twists and turns, a trippy ending(s) and some cool puzzles to solve.
                                        The game takes place in the 1980s. You play as a couple different characters depending on the mission, but primarily you’re a character whose gender, backstory and so forth you create yourself. And it turns out you’re quite the enigma. I won’t spoil the details. Suffice to say, nothing is as it seems. The final act is Black Ops at its weirdest and most inventive.
                                        The campaign’s story focuses largely on your boss, Russell Adler, and his pursuit of Soviet spy Perseus. Familiar faces like Frank Woods and Alex Mason return to the fold, and you’ll play some missions as Mason though these are side-missions.
                                        The campaign isn’t long, but you’ll likely have to play some missions more than once to gather evidence which is used in a pair of puzzles that are required to complete in order to complete the side missions the correct way. These puzzles are actually quite good, and can’t simply be looked up online to solve. To get a sense of these puzzles, check out my guides <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/11/19/operation-chaos-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-evidence-locations-guide/?sh=3e4a6e805f58">here</a>

                                        Suffice to say, I absolutely loved solving these and their addition to the campaign makes it that much better. These aren’t simply puzzles like you might find in an Uncharted game, either. They really make you think. Hopefully we see much more of this in future Call Of Duty games.
                                        The campaign isn’t long. Maybe 7 or 8 hours depending on your skill level, how much time you spend searching for evidence and exploring and the difficulty setting you select. Par for the course when it comes to this franchise, which is fine by me. So many games are so long. I enjoy getting through a campaign in just a few sittings.
                                        Is the campaign as good as Modern Warfare 2019’s? I think so, actually. I rank them fairly neck-and-neck. It even includes at least one crossover character from the Modern Warfare universe, as these two franchises grow ever closer.
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Multiplayer</span></br>
                                        Where the two games—Modern Warfare and Cold War—wildly diverge is in multiplayer. They are simply nothing alike, for better or worse. There will be those who prefer Cold War over Modern Warfare and vice versa, and far be it from me to say one is objectively better than the other. But I do prefer Modern Warfare overall for a variety of reasons. The pros and cons of both games below.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>-Gunplay is better in Modern Warfare. The sound effects of guns being fired, the oomph you feel when they’re fired, all contribute to a more satisfying gunplay experience. In a game largely about running around and shooting other players, this is paramount. Cold War, even after some improvements, still feels floaty and its guns sound tinny by comparison.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -Graphically, Modern Warfare’s multiplayer is leaps and bounds better than Cold War. The latter is more colorful, which is nice, but its aging engine shows.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -One can debate other points. Cold War doesn’t have gun mounting, which may lead to less camping. I don’t have a preference. You can’t open or burst through doors in Cold War either. That’s neither here nor there as far as I’m concerned.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -I really like Cold War’s soundtrack, which includes some fun synth tracks. I also like that we have map voting again.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -Map design is hit and miss across both games. I wish I could make a playlist out of both games’ best maps, but Activision has divided its live-service Call Of Duty franchise into separate entries each year instead of just one game, ever-evolving, with new campaigns and multiplayer options a la Destiny 2.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/Call-of-duty-cold-war-promo3.jpg" alt="CALL OF DUTY - Black Ops : Cold War promo photo" class="feature-two-promo">
                                        -Split-screen is a major issue in Black Ops games in general, and is absolute garbage once again in Cold War. It’s honestly become somewhat insulting at this point to all Call Of Duty gamers who enjoy playing couch co-op or modes like the excellent 2v2 Gunfight locally.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -Adding to that post, something I hadn’t realised at the time, is that split-screen is actually much worse than I at first realised. I was playing Gunfight with my kids the other day in split-screen and we realised that there’s a pretty atrocious bug. This bug allows the second player to see the red silhouettes of the other team’s players no matter where they are on the map instead of just at the beginning of the match. So you can see where your opponents are headed, line up your shot and win easily even against much better players. Not exactly fair. Not something that should be in a finished product of a video game.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -I despise how points are handed out in Objective-based modes. I can be the only player who stands on the hardpoint for the entirety of a match, getting nearly every point for my team, and still come in last place on the leaderboard simply because the act of playing the objective leads to fewer kills. It’s ridiculous, and Treyarch has every ability to adjust this to make it more fair and to encourage people to actually play the objective in these modes. Which many do not, since far too many Call Of Duty players think Team Deathmatch is the only mode that counts.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -I do like that Cold War is a faster, more arcadey entry in the series. I suppose this is where a Destiny 2 style approach might suffer (though if Activision continues to tie each entry to Warzone this actually makes it kind of weird—more on that in a second). In any case, Cold War feels much less like a military-sim game and much more like a video game, if that makes sense. It’s speedier and less realistic, even without double-sprint. This can be fun. In some ways, the floatier gunplay works with this movement style, and in the end much of it will come down to taste.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -What to say about Skill-Based Matchmaking? This is the Hot Topic on many gaming forums. I find it to be a non-issue in Call Of Duty. Many players seem to simply regurgitate what their favorite streamers say, but I’ve found that most matchmaking seems just fine. Sometimes I’m outmatched, but most of the time I find I’m in the upper half of the leaderboard—sometimes in the number one spot; other times dead last. I can’t attribute that entirely to matchmaking, however, since sometimes I have off days or crappy matches and sometimes I’m on fire.
                                        </br></br>
                                        -Here’s a fun story. I was playing Fortnite with my ten-year-old recently and we suddenly started getting into much more challenging matches, with players obviously far better than we were used to. I realised that this was probably SBMM kicking in since we’d been winning so much. Now we were being matched with more skilled opponents. I said something to the effect of “oh crap I think they’re putting us up against harder players because we’ve won too many matches.” But his response was simply “I guess we’ll just need to get better” or something to that effect. He wasn’t phased. That’s how we should all be with SBMM. You get placed against tougher lobbies? “Git gud”.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Overall, I have been switching between both Modern Warfare and Cold War multiplayer lately and I find both to be a lot of fun. But I only player Modern Warfare when it comes to local split-screen because Treyarch has not, after all these years, figured out how to implement something that both Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer have done without issue in Modern Warfare and WWII.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Warzone</span></br>
                                        I admire Activision’s move to free maps, seasonal content and a premium Battle Pass. It means the community is less divided as new maps are released since nobody has to pay for them anymore.
                                        On the other hand, the integration of Cold War into Warzone and the summary scrubbing of Modern Warfare, which has been made nigh invisible since Cold War’s launch despite being one of the biggest hits in series history, is a disaster.
                                        </br></br>
                                        For one thing, Warzone plays just like Modern Warfare. The game was designed by Raven Software and Infinity Ward in tandem with Modern Warfare on the same engine with the same mechanics. So you can double-sprint, mount guns and so forth. Movement is the same as Modern Warfare. Moving from Black Ops Cold War to Warzone is jarring. The two games are nothing alike, and yet here we’ve made Cold War and Warzone share a Battle Pass and weapons and all the rest.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It doesn’t work. From a business standpoint, it doesn’t even make sense. Modern Warfare was only six seasons old when Activision killed it. This is absurd. If I were an investor at Activision I would be furious. There was so much more money to make off of the integration between Warzone and Modern Warfare it’s not even funny. But now I can’t even buy cosmetics in the Modern Warfare Item Shop. Now there are no new MP maps. It’s all Cold War now, and I’m not very inclined to spend cash on that game because I don’t like it as much. I’m not alone in this.
                                        </br></br>
                                        What’s the alternative? Well, Activision and Treyarch could have gone multiple routes here. They could have released an updated Blackout battle royale game that was free-to-play just like Warzone. Maybe they didn’t want two competing free-to-play battle royales, but I’m not sure that would have been an actual problem. Fans of Black Ops would play Blackout. Fans of Modern Warfare would play Warzone. Both could have their own battle pass/seasonal systems and both could make money while each would retain its distinct play-style, mechanics and so forth.
                                        Or Treyarch could create a live-service, free-to-play Zombies game instead, and tie each Black Ops entry to that, leaving Battle Royale to Modern Warfare. Zombies is one of the most popular aspects of Black Ops as a series, and a free-to-play Zombies game that kept growing and expanding with new seasonal content over the years could be a huge hit. Either way would be better than what has happened instead—the premature death of Modern Warfare, one of my favorite FPSs in years, and the awkward, messy intertwining of Cold War and Warzone.
                                        </br></br>
                                        That being said, I’m not entirely critical. I love the new Rebirth Island map. It’s much smaller than Verdansk, and new modes like Resurgence are great fun. I also like being able to play my Cold War Operators in the Warzone engine. And use the Cold War guns in the Warzone engine, which I find superior, thus making it the best way to play Cold War ironically enough.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But other players might prefer how Cold War plays—which is fine!—and would probably love a battle royale that played just like it. So why not just release a free-to-play Blackout and have both options for players? Modern Warfare/Warzone could have ongoing seasons and a Battle Pass and so could Black Ops/Blackout and players could choose to play either/or and purchase or not purchase Battle Passes for each. Each game would have a distinct feel.
                                        If a third game from Sledgehammer is in the works still, we could have a third free-to-play battle royale to accompany it, replete with seasonal content and Battle Pass. Imagine a new WWII game or Advanced Warfare game that also had a battle royale. That would be terrific! I’d play either of those in a heartbeat, while still rotating between Warzone, Blackout and all the rest. I’ll expand on this in a separate post, but it’s hard not to talk about it in some depth in a review of Cold War. And it will remain an issue for each subsequent game Activision tries to tie to Warzone, which is why I really hope they consider simply releasing separate (but ongoing, live-service style) battle royales for each franchise instead.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Verdict</span></br>
                                        Overall, I very much enjoy Cold War. I’m glad we’ve gotten away from double-jumping and wall-running (though I wouldn’t hate that from time to time, just not every year) and I’m even happier we’ve gotten away from special Operator powers. I hated the hero shooter aspects of Black Ops 3 and 4 with a burning passion and am more than happy to return to a more traditional Call Of Duty format. “Boots on the ground” is part of that, but I think just having every player have the same access to weapons, streaks and so forth is just as important.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I also like, at least in theory, the Scorestreak system in play here. Killstreaks reward kills, but Scorestreaks reward all types of play. Not losing a streak when you die is a nice padding for less amazing players. But I still wish they would reward Objectives higher in this system (and on the leaderboard). As an Objective mode player first and foremost, this is my bias showing through. But why even have a Scorestreak system when kills count so much higher? I get just as many if not more Killstreaks in Modern Warfare, which ironically overall rewards Objective play more.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Graphically and mechanically I think this is a case of one step forward, two steps back, but I find myself enjoying the different type of play more and more as I play it. It’s a nice change of pace from the slower, more “realistic” play in Modern Warfare. If the two games weren’t both linked to Warzone, and we could continue to enjoy new Modern Warfare content, I think I’d be much happier with Cold War overall.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Still, it’s not a bad effort. The campaign is a blast and quite unique for Call Of Duty (though not that weird for Black Ops more specifically) and multiplayer is a lot of fun if you don’t need split-screen which is irredeemably and inexcusably broken. If you’re a fan of Black Ops games I think you’ll enjoy this one a lot. If you prefer Modern Warfare I suspect you’ll like it less. It’s good, not great.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is half prequel, half reboot to the Modern Warfare franchise. The game takes place before the events of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but since this is a re-imagining of the entire story, developer Infinity Ward still has plenty of room to not simply revisit the events of those earlier games, but alter and expand upon them however they see fit.</br>
                                        It’s also a return to a more grounded, realistic military shooter after years of futuristic entries (Call Of Duty: WWII notwithstanding). Gone are advanced mobility mechanics–double-jumping and wall-running–and good riddance. You’re still able to slide into a crouch, and Infinity Ward has added door-mechanics that allow you to either open doors slowly or burst through, making your entrances that much more dramatic.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Likewise, the hero-shooter aspects of Black Ops 3 and 4 are no more–and good riddance to that, as well. You have different operators to play as in multiplayer, but there are no special powers cluttering up matches. In Special Ops Operators do have passive and active abilities, but that’s co-op and it’s still toned down from what we saw in last year’s game.</br>
                                        And unlike Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare has a complete single-player campaign that’s well worth playing.</br>
                                        I’m a sucker for a good Call Of Duty campaign, and I’ll be very upfront about this: I like almost all of them. Some are better than others, but they’re always entertaining. Besides, you can fine-tune the difficulty to exactly the level of challenge you want.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>The Campaign</span></br>
                                        I played Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s campaign on “Hardened” which means I died regularly but never got stuck. I’m going to play it again on “Veteran” to really amp up the challenge, but “Hardened” is a pretty good balance between challenge and fun. “Your skills will be strained” about sums it up.</br>
                                        In any case, I know there’s been some controversy over the game’s historical accuracy, but I’m going to review it based on my experience playing rather than nit-picking the historical accuracy of a game that makes no pretense at being anything other than a total fiction.</br>
                                        The country of Urzikstan is make-believe, and while the regional politics certainly resemble the conflicts we find ourselves embroiled in in that part of the world, the game is using fictional heroes, villains and events and that’s perfectly fine.</br>
                                        There’s all kinds of historical fiction out there, with made-up countries and conflicts, whether we’re talking about books, movies or video games. I’m more interested in other questions, such as:
                                        Was the story entertaining? Was it well-written and well-acted? Was it believable and coherent within the parameters set by the fiction? Did it make me feel things? Did it speak to about the larger issues of war in the modern age?</br>
                                        I’ve played every single Call Of Duty campaign since Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (and a couple of the pre-Modern Warfare campaigns as well) and I’ve enjoyed some more than others. Some of my favorites include Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2, Black Op and Black Ops 2, World at War, WWII and Advanced Warfare.</br>
                                        Where the Modern Warfare campaign sits in the rankings of all those games is hard to say, but it’s some of the most fun I’ve had since the Modern Warfare trilogy, and I’d probably put it right above Black Ops 2 which I enjoyed immensely.</br>
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Story And Missions</span></br>
                                        For the purposes of this review, I will avoid spoilers as much as possible beyond the basic premise stuff. You should play the campaign yourself to experience its various twists and turns.</br>
                                        Captain Price (this time played by the very talented Barry Sloane) returns from the original, though he takes a far greater role in this game than in CoD4. There are some other familiar faces, as well, though Price looms largest.</br>
                                        Most of the other characters are new. A talented cast paired with impressive writing and almost lifelike facial graphics and animation makes every cutscene enjoyable.</br>
                                        The game’s two primary playable characters are Alex (Chad Michael Collins), an American CIA operative, and Kyle Garrick (Elliot Knight), a British soldier in the SAS. You’ll play as freedom fighter Farah Karim (Claudia Doumit) but only in very short instances.</br>
                                        Like the previous Modern Warfare games and first two Black Ops games, the story takes place in “modern” times. This isn’t historical or futuristic. Most of the story takes place in fictional Urzikstan though some of it takes place elsewhere, including the UK.</br>
                                        The story pits three factions against one another. There’s the united US/UK forces who team up with Farah’s freedom fighters; the brutal Russian occupiers of Urzikstan led by Roman Barkov; and the terrorist group Al-Qatala led by Omar "The Wolf" Sulaman. Various twists and turns throughout the campaign tinker with this three-pronged dynamic, and you begin to realize that it’s not at all as cut and dry as it seemed at first, but I won’t spoil any of that.</br>
                                        The game largely takes place in the present timeline, but occasionally dips back into Farah and her brother Hadir’s backstory. These are the sequences you play as Farah (for the most part). Everything else switches between Alex and Kyle, and you’ll bounce all over the place for these missions.</br>
                                        The game often nods to past Modern Warfare titles, with some sequences mirroring (though not replicating) some of the best moments in CoD4. For instance, at one point you have to crawl under a truck in a convoy, and then moments later lay in a field of bodies as a troop of Russian soldiers walks slowly past. This is certainly reminiscent of “All Ghillied Up” though much briefer and less original.
                                        There’s another scene where you briefly fire rockets and down on tiny little enemy soldiers and tanks that’s like CoD4’s Death From Above mission but again, much more brief and much more part of the breathtaking action rather than the almost detached brutality of the original.
                                        </br></br>
                                        There are other, similar scenes but I won’t spoil any. I don’t mind these callbacks at all, to be honest, though I’m not sure the game ever quite rises to the level of CoD4 simply because it relies too often on these moments rather than creating new sequences as memorable.</br>
                                        Perhaps the most memorable sequence in Modern Warfare 2019 takes place in the UK when Kyle and Captain Pierce, along with other special forces units, clear out a building with terrorists and civilians inside, including women and children. I accidentally shot one of the women a terrorist was using as a human shield. I felt bad about it, too. Another woman pulled a gun on us as we cleared the building. It was hard to know who was a target and who was a civilian.</br>
                                        From start to finish, Modern Warfare’s campaign is a tense, challenging, brutal and beautiful experience. It’s Call Of Duty, so don’t expect the most emotional or profound story. Expect an intense, action-packed shooter with plenty of military jargon, some surprisingly relatable characters, and lots of violence. It’s an excellent campaign and I’m thrilled that Infinity Ward has taken the franchise back to its Modern Warfare roots.</br>
                                        I will say that one character’s ending left me a little cold. It seemed to abrupt and too played down for what it was. But for the most part, I loved how the game ended–the denouement and post-credits scenes are excellent–and how it opens up so many possibilities for the future of this series.</br>
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Multiplayer</span></br>
                                        Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s multiplayer comes with two halves: Competitive multiplayer and co-operative Special Ops. Progression carries over between these two modes, and bits of story also cross over between the campaign and Special Ops, while multiplayer maps are often clearly inspired by levels in the campaign.</br>
                                        There’s been much ado over Modern Warfare’s map design, which is quite different from recent Call Of Duty games, largely (though not entirely) abandoning the three-lane map structure of past maps in favor of more open-ended maps. Many of these maps are littered with camping positions. This, combined with a brutally fast TTK (time-to-kill) can lead to a more cautious play-style, which some people feel is more tactical and others hate.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I love it, quite frankly. It took me a little while to get used to the new maps and play-style, but I really enjoy them now, including ones I didn’t like much at first such as Piccadilly, an urban map set in London replete with large buses, city streets and cramped indoor areas.</br>
                                        Other maps include more traditional three-lane-ish fare like Gun Runner or Hackney Yard. Still others are sprawling, such as Aniyah Palace, which almost feels too big for its own good.</br>
                                        Runnig-and-gunning may not work as well as it used to, but just because Modern Warfare is a bit slower and more tactical hardly means it’s slow or boring. Yes, you might get killed by campers more often, but you that just means you have to adjust your play-style a bit. Be more cautious. Learn where people like to camp. I know, change is hard. But in this case, I think it’s also very good.</br>
                                        Gameplay is essentially what you’ve come to expect from Call Of Duty though there’s some nice little additions like the ability to mount your gun on most surfaces, whether that’s the corner of a wall or a crate you’re using for cover. This is a great feature that I hope the franchise continues to use in later games.
                                        </br></br>
                                        There’s some cool little changes to the game’s structure that make it even more enjoyable. The “Pick 10” system is gone, allowing you to customize your loadout in much greater depth. Customization is deepened further by the gunsmith system, which allows you to tinker with numerous attachments for each of your weapons, each with some kind of pro and con–improve stability but slow aim-down-sights (ADS) and so forth.</br>
                                        Better still, you can change loadouts and attachments mid-match, something long overdue in this series. Not happy with your assault rifle? Or just the scope you chose? Maybe you’d like to try out some different perks? That can all take place while in a match. It’s very cool.</br>
                                        Multiplayer also now has a whole bunch of different types of match beyond traditional game modes like Domination, Team Death Match and so forth. It has all those, but there’s also now, on top of 6 vs 6, 10 vs 10, 20 vs 20 and even 32 vs 32 in Ground War, which is basically Call Of Duty’s version of Battlefield.
                                        One of the best new modes is Gunfight, which pits teams of two against one another with preset, randomly cycling loadouts for quick-burst matches on tiny maps. This is a fast-paced, incredibly competitive mode that’s a real blast, especially if you have a solid teammate–i.e. it’s best if you play with a friend rather than randoms.</br>
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Special Ops.</span></br>
                                        That’s also true of Special Ops, Modern Warfare’s cooperative multiplayer. This replaces Zombies (finally) and is a nice break from that mode. Special Ops is comprised of Operations, Missions and, on PS4, Survival modes. Operations are story-driven objective stages; Missions are shorter, less involved tests of skill; and Survival Mode–a wave-based horde mode–is exclusive to PS4 until Oct 1st, 2020.
                                        I’ve enjoyed the Operations quite a bit so far, but your success really does depend on your team actually playing like a team, and that’s tricky with randoms. It’s tricky enough in competitive multiplayer in objective-based modes like Domination when half your team just wants kills instead of playing the objective–it’s even harder when you play with teams in Special Ops who have no interest in reviving downed teammates or sticking together. That’s not the mode’s fault, of course, but it is a challenge to overcome.</br>
                                        All told, the sheer breadth of mutliplayer options on offer in Modern Warfare gives players an astounding amount of stuff to do, modes to play, challenges to overcome. Speaking of which, there are daily and special challenges (get X number of kills with a shotgun style) available now and once the Battle Pass is live I’m sure there will be more. I’m having the most fun I’ve had in multiplayer since War Mode was introduced in Call Of Duty: WWII, which reminds me that I really wish this game had War Mode. Oh well. You can’t have everything.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Other changes from last year’s game include the return to auto-healing. Infinity Ward was wise to remove this from multiplayer (an annoying change in Black Ops 4) as well as the campaign (an annoying change in WWII) and so we’re back to traditional auto-healing where the screen gets faded around the edges when you’re hurt and you hear pounding in your ears.</br>
                                        And to top it all off, you now can play against friends on other platforms. For the first time, Call Of Duty is launching with crossplay between PC, PS4 and Xbox One, with a variety of options to make sure you’re not going up against mouse-and-keyboard players with a controller if you don’t want to. That means you can play with your friends who don’t own a console, or with your brother who owns an Xbox One instead of a PS4 like you. It’s terrific.</br>
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Graphics and Sound</span></br>
                                        Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare CREDIT: INFINITY WARD
                                        Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare might just be the most photo-realistic video game I’ve ever played. The faces are just about as close to “real” as I’ve ever seen in a game. It’s gorgeous, especially on PC with ray-tracing enabled. (Though you’ll want to turn down film-grain on PC, at least. It makes everything look muddy, at least in MP).</br>
                                        I played on PS4 and PC and while both are incredible looking, there’s no doubt that PC is the winner. The game is at times simply jaw-dropping, especially in the campaign which is lush with various environments, massive explosions and the ridiculously lifelike faces.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The sound design is as on point as ever, minus the overly-loud footsteps at launch and the overaggressive “chatter” in multiplayer. These have been toned down, thankfully.
                                        The excellent weapon sound design is one reason why this franchise’s gunplay is so good. Like the graphics, the sound design has improved over the years and it just makes the shooting that much tighter and more intense.</br>
                                        Meanwhile, the original score by Sarah Schachner is excellent–an intense musical companion to the intense campaign. It’s not my favorite Call of Duty OST–in modern memory, I’m quite partial to WWII’s OST by Wilbert Roget II and its sweeping horns. But this one is quite good, especially in its Middle Eastern pieces like “Farah.”</br>
                                        The game looks and sounds incredible. It’s almost a shame so many ugly things happen in the campaign. Such beauty juxtaposed with such ugliness.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Bugs and Other Issues</span></br>
                                        So far, I’ve had very few issues with this game. I know that is not the case for many others. I’ve spent the vast majority of my time reviewing Modern Warfare on PC rather than PS4, and the worst issues I’ve personally encountered were graphical fiascos in multiplayer.</br>
                                        Once, I entered a match and had to quit because the light was so bright I couldn’t see anything. It was like I’d just been to the eye doctors and had my eyes dilated and then walked brazenly into a bright, sunny day. At times the images have just become massively distorted and glitched out.</br>
                                        I haven’t had any crashes, however, though I know this has plagued the Xbox community in particular and the PC community as well. Word of warning, then, you may experience crashes and other errors I haven’t experienced.
                                        </br></br>
                                        People have also complained about the SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) but I haven’t noticed anything too terrible. Sure, at times I’m more on point than others, and at times it seems like I’ve been matched against players that are just ridiculously better than me and my team, but that’s always been an issue with Call Of Duty and plenty of other competitive online games.</br>
                                        I’ve also heard complaints about netcode and lag compensation but for the most part (on my very fast internet connection) I haven’t noticed anything too egregious, and I suspect that these are blown out of proportion, as per usual.</br>
                                        As far as joining matches goes, I’ve had a pretty easy time of it, usually finding new matches in well under a minute and loading in quickly and without issues.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I’ve played on two different desktops–my newer machine has an AMD Ryzen 3700X CPU, an RTX 2080 Super GPU, is entirely SSD-based with 32 GB RAM; my older PC has an i7-6700K CPU, a GTX 1080 GPU, a mixture of SSD and traditional HDs, and 16 GB of RAM. It runs great on either machine, though the older one doesn’t have ray-tracing and can’t run it at quite as high of settings. I’ve played on QHD monitors, aka 2560x1440 resolution and have had no frame-rate issues whatsoever.</br>
                                        In any case, many of these issues should be ironed out with patches. From my personal experience, there’s nothing game-breaking going on, but Xbox One X players in particular have had a rough time with hard crashes, so keep that in mind.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Verdict</span></br>
                                        So far, I’m having a terrific time with Modern Warfare. A return to a modern setting is exactly the game I’ve wanted for years now, and I’m thrilled that Infinity Ward has found its groove again after some fumbles. While I enjoyed both Ghosts and Infinite Warfare, I didn’t love either game. Infinite Warfare had a pretty good campaign, but I was much less impressed with the futuristic gameplay in multiplayer.
                                        Modern Warfare gets the series back to its roots with plenty of nods to the 2007 original, but it also does enough to keep the game fresh and exciting, and it looks simply stunning on both console and PC.
                                        A strong campaign, tons of multiplayer options including big team Ground War and 2 vs 2 Gunfight, and a break from Zombies co-op with the return of Special Ops–what’s not to love?
                                        </br></br>
                                        It is important to note that the Battle Pass system has not yet been implemented. This year, all post-launch maps will be free and Activision has stated that loot boxes / supply drops are no more. Instead, there will be a seasonal Battle Pass a la Fortnite, with cosmetic rewards that you earn through play. This is all excellent news, but since they haven’t included it in the game yet I can’t say for sure whether it’s a good system or not. I’ll update this review accordingly once that happens. Hopefully Activision doesn’t pull any funny business, introducing loot boxes or paid maps down the road–but I wouldn’t put it past them.</br>
                                        Still, all signs point to major improvements in terms of post-launch revenue and hopefully it stays that way. Hopefully Infinity Ward also keeps communicating with players about the issues they’re having with the game, as open communication is vital to the community and game.</br>
                                        In any case, if you’ve been holding off on buying new Call Of Duty games, or if you’re just sick of the futuristic shooters or the hero-shooter aspects of Black Ops 4, this is the perfect time to return to the series. Even if you just play for the campaign, I think this one is worth your time and money. I give it a Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell rating.</br>

                                        <span>Ghost of Tsushima is at its best when it’s quiet.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        The latest PS4 game from developer Sucker Punch is an attempt to merge the structure of a conventional open-world game with the setting of a classic samurai film. Think of it as Assassin’s Creed by way of Akira Kurosawa. When things click, it’s amazing; Ghost is a beautiful game, one full of focused, contemplative moments, from tense, one-on-one sword duels to peaceful retreats to compose haiku under a tree. Ghost doesn’t hit the same highs as its cinematic inspirations, but it apes their themes and style in a way that at least feels unique for a video game.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The problem is that it so often isn’t quiet. Open-world games are big and busy, and those elements — the gigantic battles, the sprawling map, the copious sidequests, the repetitive mission structure — drown out what makes Ghost feel special. The two sides of the game feel constantly at odds. When it works, it’s incredible. The rest of the time, it’s yet another open-world action game.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima takes place in 13th century Japan, when a Mongolian army has invaded the titular island. You play as Jin Sakai, one of the only remaining samurai on Tsushima following a large-scale attack that wiped out much of the warrior population. Initially, Jin’s goal is relatively small: he wants to rescue his uncle, leader of the Tsushima samurai, who has been captured by the Mongol leader. Eventually, as these things so often do, the stakes get higher. Jin becomes the de facto leader of a resistance force trying to thwart the invasion and keep it from spreading to the Japanese mainland.

                                        This process isn’t straightforward. The conflict at the core of the game isn’t just between two opposing armies; it’s also inside Jin himself. At the outset, he’s a traditional samurai who faces his foes head-on and values honor above all else. But that doesn’t necessarily win you wars. In order to successfully fight off the ruthless invading force — which makes use of siege weapons and tactics designed to terrorize the enemy — he’s forced to try different tactics.
                                        </br></br>
                                        This plays out in a few different ways. The most important is the way Jin changes. He slowly sheds his samurai upbringing to become something else, making use of stealth tactics, morally questionable weapons like poison darts, and more to become what the residents of Tsushima call simply “the ghost.” By the end, he’s basically a samurai Batman, armed with a huge array of combat skills and useful gadgets.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But Jin can’t do it alone, which feeds into the structure of the game. A bulk of the quests in Ghost of Tsushima are about preparing to fight the Mongols and kill their leader. That means drumming up support from the residents of the island — including a core group of four allies, among them a warrior monk and a disgraced bow master — seeking out new skills and weapons, and clearing out camps, towns, and farmland to set up safe zones.
                                        </br></br>

                                        It sounds cool, but for the most part, it plays out much like any other game in the genre. The missions — in particular, the sidequests — can be painfully generic. They almost all involve going to an area, clearing it of enemies, and possibly collecting an important item along the way. Some require stealth, others climbing or tracking, and almost every one forces you to walk or ride alongside another character while they tell you something seemingly important. Ghost of Tsushima is a well-made game, but it often betrays a serious lack of imagination. You may feel like you’ve been transported to 13th century Japan, but that doesn’t mean you can get away from explosive red barrels or the ubiquitous turret sequence.
                                        </br></br>

                                        </br></br>
                                        These elements aren’t bad, per se. It’s just they’ve been seen so many times before, whether it’s in Assassin’s Creed, Shadow of Mordor, The Witcher, or virtually any other open-world game from the last 10 years. What makes this particularly frustrating is that the new elements Ghost does bring to the genre are interesting and fit so well with the game’s themes and setting. But they get lost inside a paint-by-numbers structure.
                                        </br></br>

                                        A great example of this is the combat. Jin is a samurai master, and he controls like one. Over the course of the game, you’ll learn different stances, each of which works particularly well against a specific type of enemy and has slightly different controls to match. The result is that combat feels different depending on whether you’re up against a big, hulking brute or a skilled swordsman with a shield. Likewise, the game encourages exploration and pushes you toward goals in often subtle ways. There’s a feature called “guiding wind” which is exactly what it sounds like: you’ll see a gust of wind pointing in the direction of your current objective. It’s mostly a gentle reminder, as opposed to the firm push games typically give the player. When it comes to exploration, there’s a similar light touch; you might see a golden bird or brown fox, nudging you to follow them toward something interesting.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The issue is that these ideas are frequently buried underneath or undermined by traditional open-world elements. Fighting against small groups of enemies is a lot of fun, for instance; you have to think about your stance, and you can mix things up with weapons like hidden throwing blades. But often, the game throws waves and waves of enemy soldiers at you, and it turns into a button-mashing frenzy. Likewise, the act of spontaneous discovery and exploration isn’t so fun when the roads are filled with enemy soldiers and other dangers. The idea of getting into yet another battle discouraged me from venturing off in any direction to see what I could find; as much as I love horseback riding in games and taking in the scenery, I often resorted to the fast travel option instead.
                                        </br></br>
                                        My absolute favorite moments in Ghost of Tsushima are when things are stripped down to their very core. For key battles, the game utilizes a dueling format that is incredibly pared down. There are no stances or special weapons. It’s just you and a sword, using timing and quick reflexes to defeat your opponent. There are also more contemplative moments that are completely devoid of violence. If you find a restorative hot spring, you can sit and reflect on things that happened during your journey to that point. There are quiet spots where you can sit and compose a haiku from prewritten lines; Jin will scan the world around for inspiration, and you choose what he writes down. It’s rare that a blockbuster action game asks you to do anything so calm and meditative, but it’s a wonderful reprieve from the blood-soaked action.
                                        </br></br>
                                        ￼<span>“IT’S RARE THAT A BLOCKBUSTER GAME ASKS YOU TO DO ANYTHING SO CALM AND MEDITATIVE”.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        These moments often feel hidden. If you want Ghost to be more than a standard action game, you need to search out these elements. Thankfully, unlike, say, Days Gone, the world and story are at least interesting. While I skipped a number of the sidequests, I made sure to play through the storylines for each of Jin’s close allies who have their own narrative threads that kept me away from the main storyline; characters range from a disgraced sensei seeking out his top pupil who defected to the Mongol army to a reformed thief trying to make a better life. Learning more about these people was enough to push me through some of the more tedious sidequests. It’s a testament to the acting and writing that, even though I saw most of the major story beats coming, I was still caught up in what was happening.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima also tries to weave its gameplay and narrative together in an interesting way that ultimately doesn’t quite work. Essentially, the game wants you to feel guilty for Jin’s transformation. Often, when you do something not particularly honorable, like use a dart to poison an unsuspecting soldier, you’re greeted with a flashback sequence in which a young Jin is told by his sensei that “when we take their life, we look them in the eye.” In the present day, Jin is forced to constantly admit that “I did what I had to do.” The problem is you pretty much have to play as a ghost; the game is both more difficult and less fun to play as a rule-abiding samurai, and certain missions force a stealth approach. Having the game admonish you for playing with the new toy it just gave you never actually made me feel guilty at all. It didn’t help that I felt like Jin was actually doing the right thing, despite going against his code, by sacrificing himself and his reputation to help his people.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Perhaps Ghost is suffering from unrealistic expectations. After all, it is a well-crafted, if not particularly imaginative, adventure that evokes some of the most important films of all time. But it’s also the last big PS4 exclusive. And after a string of creative and daring hits, including ￼<span>Death Stranding</span>, ￼<span>The Last of Us Part II</span>, and ￼<span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span>, Ghost of Tsushima is something of a letdown. We’ve also seen that it’s entirely possible to take the well-worn open-world structure and twist it in some way to keep it fresh, whether that’s ￼<span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span>’s imaginative setting or ￼<span>Spider-Man</span>’s web-slinging, but Ghost plays things too safe.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima just doesn’t dig far enough into what makes it unique. It’s big and beautiful — but you have to have the patience of a samurai to discover what makes it

                                            <span>A dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life</br>
                                            Rockstar North's Grand Theft Auto update is a freewheeling, nihilistic satire on western society – as well as ridiculous fun.</span>
                                            </br></br>
                                            There has been a particular theory going round for the last year or so, that "box set" TV has replaced movies as the preferred form of mass, culturally meaningful entertainment. It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, hints at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.
                                            </br></br>
                                            This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.
                                            </br></br>
                                            The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychopathic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.
                                            </br></br>

                                            GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.
                                            </br></br>
                                            To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.
                                            </br></br>

                                            Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises "the realistic art of contemporary killing".
                                            </br></br>
                                            This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is dangerous, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/gta5-promo3.jpg" alt="Grand Theft Auto : V Promo Photo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                            This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a lot of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think "Ugh, not another car ride". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call "the exposition expedition": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.
                                            </br></br>

                                            Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.

                                            The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout and Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.
                                            </br></br>
                                            The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your own vehicle spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.
                                            </br></br>
                                            And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. [Spoiler] Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim [spoiler ends]. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.
                                            </br></br>
                                            And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, "you all live in Los Santos now". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.

                                        <span>King of the kill.</span>
                                        Agent 47’s unique brand of slow-paced stealth in an assortment of dense, deadly, and deeply varied murder playgrounds has reached a wonderful crescendo in Hitman 3. While it doesn’t stray from the killer chord combination developer IO Interactive crafted for 2016’s Hitman – and continued to use in 2018’s Hitman 2 – it’s abundantly clear here that the studio has well and truly mastered its act.
                                        </br></br>
                                        With some of the most surprising and imaginative levels in the series so far, Hitman 3 may feel largely familiar to its two most-recent predecessors, but just thinking of the hours upon hours of chaos, carnage, and cruel comedy that each of its six outstanding new maps will produce makes me giddy.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z29ORu6_p34" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        This final chapter of IO’s ‘World of Assassination’ trilogy that began with 2016’s Hitman might be better thought of as an expansion than a sequel. If you’ve bounced off Hitman before – particularly in the last five years – know that there’s been no big reinvention of the bald bloke’s blueprint in Hitman 3. The interface and controls have remained consistent in their stiffness, and the range of uses for your weapons and items aren’t drastically different, either. The most notable new toy in Hitman 3 is a camera which can be used to hack or examine switches and items, which is handy but not really a game changer.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>All six of Hitman 3’s beautiful and strikingly well-lit levels are amongst the strongest of the series, so much so that it’s hard to pick a standout favourite“.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        The true strength of Hitman 3, then, is found in its maps. All six of Hitman 3’s beautiful and strikingly well-lit levels are amongst the strongest of the series, so much so that it’s hard to pick a standout favourite. Things get off to a fairly stunning start, with 47 parachuting onto the world’s tallest building in Dubai and infiltrating its opulent interior, but that high bar is maintained throughout. The follow-up mission is a nod and a wink to Contracts’ Beldingford Manor map and takes 47 to a similarly massive UK country manor where one entertainingly ironic route to killing your target involves posing as a detective who’s there to solve a murder on the property. 
                                        </br></br>

                                        From there it’s off to a massive German rave for a mission that oozes atmosphere and puts an interesting twist on hunting down your five targets amongst the throngs of sweaty, 24-hour party people, and then to Chongqing, China, where the glow of neon lights, the reflections in the soaked streets, and the trickle of rain down 47’s jacket combine for perhaps the most visually impressive mission of the series so far. The next stop is an Argentinian vineyard that reminded me of Blood Money’s excellent A Vintage Year map, only vastly bigger; then the finale is a fabulous surprise unlike any Hitman mission to date, and one which I sincerely hope isn’t spoiled for you.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s tricky to speak about these locations in too much detail without ruining the thrill of strolling through them and revealing massive new areas you had no idea existed, but these environments are truly some of the most memorable and remarkable maps IO has ever created – from the intimidating verticality on display while perched on the outside of the highest skyscraper in the world to the rustic charm of Thornbridge Manor. I’m equally hesitant to reveal the quirky assassination opportunities they contain but I will say Hitman 3 contains both the funniest and the most complex Hitman kill I’ve ever played – and at least one of the most-dastardly – and there are still many I haven’t got to yet. Yes, a lot of the kills are gentle remixes of ones that have come before, but they’re still cleverly built up.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/hitman-3-promo2.jpg" alt="Hitman 3 Promo Photo" class="feature-one-promo">

                                        As always, the slow-burn thrill of these games comes from planning, patience, and hiding in plain sight. The key to success is finding the perfect disguise for exploration, listening and looking for opportunities, and getting the timing just right to pull off the perfect crime and escape unseen. It’s an unapologetically single-player experience that rewards rational thinking over rushing, although it is flexible enough to cater to both extremes: those who prefer to follow the multilayered mini-stories playing out within the levels to make invisible, surgical strikes and disappear without a trace, and those who like to improvise and leave behind piles of dead and unconscious men in their underpants stacked like cordwood.
                                        </br></br>
                                        You can get away with all of this because the often hilariously naïve AI is still easy to exploit as ever. Of course, tricking the dopey guards and civilians with unexpected distractions and suspicious items has emerged as such a fundamental part of the puzzle solving in the current Hitman trilogy, and I’ve actually grown to love these dumb bastards over the years. These folks won’t even blink an eye at a severe-faced stranger who’s wearing the clothes of a man they’ve very recently had a conversation with and, while that does rob stealthy victories of believability at times, this kind of suspension of disbelief is simply necessary for Hitman to function. As grim as the murder-for-hire premise seems on the surface, this has always been a cheekily self-aware series that relishes in a general degree of silliness and gallows humour.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>“As grim as the murder-for-hire premise seems on the surface, this has always been a cheekily self-aware series that relishes in a general degree of silliness and gallows humour“.

                                        </br></br>
                                        These great levels are linked together by the conclusion to the limp story arc that kicked off in 2016. While this hackneyed story of competing shadow organisations is unlikely to have Netflix power brokers sprinting to the nearest chequebook, it’s nice to have it wrapped after five years – even if it’s been entirely inessential to my enjoyment of the levels themselves. Now, at least, we’ll be able to move on to something that’s hopefully a bit different.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The biggest advantage of there not being any revolutionary changes in Hitman 3 is that owners of Hitman and Hitman 2 can carry over their levels and progress to Hitman 3. There’s a certain tidiness to rolling the trilogy into a single product that I really like, and I admire IO’s commitment to keeping the previous games’ content alive like this.
                                        </br></br>
                                        On Xbox Series X this is mostly seamless; as an owner of both previous Hitman games on Xbox One, Hitman 3 was automatically augmented with all previous maps, although the progression carry-over functionality wasn’t operational for me at the time of review. The PC situation is hindered somewhat by the shift from Steam to the Epic Games Store, though IO Interactive has gone on the record that an import feature will be available within weeks.
                                        ￼</br></br>
                                        It’s also proven to be a little unruly on PlayStation 5. Despite having both previous games installed, Hitman 3 is directing me to further downloads to allow access – neither of which are available at time of review.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The lack of native support for PSVR on PS5 also meant I had to download and install the PS4 version of Hitman 3 alongside the PS5 version, which is a bit of a messy solution – but that’s really on Sony rather than IO. For its part, IO provides a free digital copy of the PS4 version to all who buy the PS5 version so nobody misses out.
                                        </br></br>
                                        When you get it up and running, Hitman in VR is worth a dabble if you own a PSVR, though really only to experience its general slapstick goofiness first-hand. You have to play with the DualShock 4 because the Move controllers just don’t have enough buttons and, while it can generally handle melee attacks, the shooting experience is really quite cumbersome, imprecise, and irritating as a consequence.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The end result is a system that winds up marooned halfway between full motion controls and traditional controls – which I found regularly brain-bending and occasionally stomach churning. There’s no denying that getting access to all of Hitman and Hitman 2’s levels in VR is incredible value – and it’s a novelty feeling as if you’re truly inside these levels – but it’s janky, primitive, and really not the best way to play.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Verdict</span>
                                        Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IO’s idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series. The fundamentals haven’t changed since 2016 but its collection of outstanding maps makes for a refined, reliable, and robust curtain-closer to the current Hitman trilogy. Six maps may sound slim but each one is huge and designed to be played several times over – and even then it’s very unlikely you’ll have uncovered all of its creative and surprising assassination opportunities. There really isn’t a weak one in the bunch. This barcoded butcher has made a lot of appearances over the past 20 years, but Hitman 3 is definitely one of his best.

                                        PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds didn’t invent the last-person-standing formula that’s made it one of the most massively successful PC games in history, but – over the course of a nine-month-long early access period – it certainly turned it into something special. 100 players drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever weapons they can find within a shrinking force-field. This simple, bare-bones take on the Battle Royale-style deathmatch foregoes the fluff and high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in favor of fast, accessible action. The result is a tight, focused, no-frills experience that’s as exciting as it is unpredictable, and where no two games are ever alike.
                                        </br></br>
                                        PUBG wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as you and up to 99 other players airdrop onto one of its two 8x8 km maps from the back of a large aircraft. Part of the genius of each match’s arc is how heavily it weighs every move you make, and it begins with the critical decision of where to land. Jumping early along the plane’s randomized flight path lets you hit the ground first, giving you a jump on the competition, but risks placing you farther from the parts of the arena where the fighting will likely funnel as the boundaries contract. Jumping late might distance you from other players, giving you some early breathing room and a chance to forage for loot in peace before entering the fray. Depending on the angle of the flight path, jumping right into the center — especially in large cities and other loot-heavy spots — could place you right in the middle of the action with some of the most trigger-happy opponents.
                                        </br></br><img src="../resources/images/games/promo/pubg-promo1.jpg" alt="PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Promo Photo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity, but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground, as everybody (no matter where you land) scrambles for weapons and gear, and the killing kicks off right from the get-go. Item distribution is partially randomized, and learning the spots on the maps that are likely to spawn military-grade weapons and attachments is a good, early strategy to work out on your own, with a team of up to four, or using the many fan-made resources that already exist thanks to PUBG’s hearty run in Early Access. You can’t count on finding a good gun early to keep you safe, but unlike similar games like DayZ, where you could potentially go long, tedious stretches without finding a weapon, there’s bound to be something worth picking up no matter where you drop. Backpacks for holding more items, a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests, medical supplies, melee weapons, and a good mix of firearms are in good supply.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But no matter what gear you find, PUBG excels at creating a reliable and streamlined space for your adventure to play out while also allowing for a thrilling level of unpredictability. It isn’t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR-L assault rifle, since good gear is only half the battle — the other half is wit.</br>
                                        As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse, those still standing are forced into ever-closer proximity within the confines of a deadly, shrinking force-field until just one player or team is left alive. Victory (accompanied by the coveted “Winner, winner, chicken dinner!” screen) is an exhilarating reward, matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it. But even if you die early, jumping into a new game is always quick and easy.

                                        The deadly, moving force-field that contains the arena and occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a consistent sense of purpose that drives you toward conflict, and with it, an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize reaching the center of the circle to make the next incremental reduction in size of the survivable area easier to deal with; move slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into the open to avoid the oncoming doom; or even hide in a building until you absolutely have to move, letting everyone else kill each other so you don’t have to. Hopping into a vehicle, like the speedy but vulnerable motorbike and buggy, the sturdy closed-top UAZ, or the slow-but-durable van — among others — is a quick, fun, and conspicuous way to cover a lot of ground, and can result in some hilarious and explosive encounters. Either way, you’re encouraged to stay on the move, but still have a set of options that lets you pick your pace. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious defense, and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly liberating, bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to plan around and tackle as the next.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky) survivors, condensing the action and ending a match after around 20 minutes, before it can get bogged down by campers or other distractions. Action isn’t hard to find if you’re looking for it, and impossible to avoid for long when you’re not, but PUBG manages to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet, tense moments of cautious exploration intact.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The two large maps aren't the best-looking environments in gaming, but they do provide much-needed variety on the battlefield. Both the forested island of Erangel and the sunny desert of Miramar boast an assortment of small towns, large, dense cityscapes, and rural industrial zones ripe with loot. There are some parallels between maps so as not to restrict your options when you’re dropped randomly into either one (the server picks for you). For instance, the small military base on an island off the coast of Erangel sees its match in Miramar’s remote military camp, for the high-risk players looking to compete for high-level equipment right off the bat.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But both maps have their own unique merits, too. The abundance of trees on Erangel provides plenty of cover, even for groups of four, while the sparser, rockier Miramar makes moving across open areas on foot and in vehicles much more dangerous. While some areas in Miramar feel more isolated than even the most secluded spots on Erangel, the diversity of elevations, more interesting city layouts, and some great map-exclusive weapons — like a sawed-off shotgun that fits conveniently in the sidearm slot — more than make up for it. Adapting to new challenges and making last-minute decisions based on each of these factors is part of the fun. But no matter what you’re facing, an abundance of loot in even the smallest buildings in both maps ensures hunting for a weapon is never a frustrating task, which not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone, but ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.
                                        </br></br>
                                        You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods, or on either end of a deadly hunt across a dense city or town. You might even find yourself holed up in an attic, listening for the slightest creak or scape to indicate a nearby presence, shotgun in hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby enemies is one of the ways PUBG forces you to stay attentive and tactical rather than treating every round like a fast-paced shooter à la Call of Duty or Battlefield. Play long enough, and you can learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a place before you — an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should watch your back. All these layers merge to build a shooter that’s invested in creating smart, nuanced survival and understands how even the smallest moments of your story build up to create the larger adventure.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Last One(s) Standing</span>
                                        The entire dynamic of both exploration and combat changes drastically by grouping up in the pre-game lobby. Playing solo brings certain elements to the formula that going in with a partner doesn’t, and the same goes for trios and four-player squads. There might be more freedom and greater opportunity for stealth in going alone, but a well-coordinated team has more potential for pulling off exciting ambushes and vehicular assaults – and they’re much more survivable because you can revive a teammate who’s been knocked down but not finished off. Playing in first-person-only servers also brings a new, challenging dimension to matches by eliminating the corner-peaking advantages granted by the default third-person camera.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The gunplay itself is also great. Firearms feel good to shoot and there’s a good range of options for all playstyles. And while PUBG does retain that military-sim stiffness that’s become synonymous with the genre, it’s just smoothed out enough to keep combat and movement satisfying and accessible to newcomers. The new vaulting system (added as PUBG left Early Access) is a particularly handy addition, allowing you to climb over fences and through windows for easier getaways and sneakier shortcuts.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Other than that, a couple handy hotkeys to cycle weapons, switch between third- or first-person perspective, toggle auto or burst fire for your gun, and adjust zeroing distance are most of what you need to know beyond the obvious. The simple and intuitive UI is also particularly refined, which makes looting bodies and swapping items with teammates as easy as a quick click and drag.
                                        </br>
                                        A number of quality-of-life features round out even PUBG’s roughest edges: being able to access your inventory and map while on the move, adjust the camera mid-stride without changing direction, and a generous leniency with fall damage stand out as some of the most valuable. Since the 1.0 launch, I haven’t experienced significant performance or rubberbanding issues, but it’s important to note that version 1.0 still hasn’t managed to eliminate the hacking problem that’s most prevalent in high-skill matchmaking games, or a handful of persistent bugs.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Verdict</span>
                                        PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end.

                                        <span></span>
                                        As the first new project from <span>Rockstar Games</span> this generation, it feels like a lot is riding on Red Dead Redemption 2. The prequel is predictably loaded with the gameplay improvements and unexpected oddities that make other Rockstar open-worlds so attractive. But now the whole system is designed to give you more choices and make you feel more connected, no matter how you decide to spend your time. The effect it achieves is remarkable.
                                        </br></br>
                                        You control outlaw Arthur Morgan, an elite member of the Dutch van der Linde gang. You start in the snow-packed mountains after barely surviving a botched robbery. Dutch and family take shelter from the harsh weather while plotting to regain their fortune and seek revenge on their enemies. As you make more money and cause more trouble, the gang is forced to keep moving to new safe spots and to find new towns to rob.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Unlike the bounty-focused revenge crusade in Red Dead Redemption, Arthur’s story is more about secrecy and survival. Most missions are done to fill your pockets with cash and grow the gang. While you won’t learn much about Arthur’s past beyond a few news clippings, photographs, and casual conversations, the personalities that surround you keep the story approachable and grounded. Newcomers to Red Dead should have no problem following along, but there are lots of gratifying moments for series fans. The central campaign lasts for dozens of hours, excluding the many bonus threads you’ll pick up while traveling, and it concludes with an epilogue that vastly exceeds expectations.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/red-dead-redemption-2-promo1.jpg" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2 Promo Photo" class="feature-two-promo">
                                        The missions team you up with individual gang members right away and they keep giving you chances to understand each person’s perspective, whether it’s a black man confronting racism, or a Native American watching the government betray his people. You’re given a lot of choice, and certain objectives can be skipped if you’re not in the mood. Conversations evolve depending on the order you complete quests, and prior events are often referenced by the people you work with. Outside of these jobs, you can catch up with your associates back at camp.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Your movable hideout functions as a conduit for each chapter’s events. You can chat with friends to pass the time and upgrade the camp visually with perfectly harvested animal skins. You can add or improve the available supply storage, and other members will donate money to the cause when they can. With hours of animation and dialogue to set each scene, the camp is impressively realized, and it’s delightful to pause your progress and slowly sip a cup of coffee on a cold morning or sit and listen to a guitar by the campfire after a rough day.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Details like this, that give the world life, are everywhere. A million little moments just waiting to surprise you. You can provoke your surroundings by targeting people, animals, or objects with the left trigger. Your choices shift depending on the context, so you use the same lock-on method to brush your horse, rob a store, or talk to strangers. Whether you chat with every person or not, it feels good to know the option is there. Gang members will only have one or two-line replies at any given time, but even that adds a tremendous amount of character to the proceedings.
                                        </br></br>
                                        As you pillage the land, your honor will be questioned. Good and bad deeds effect what you see as events unfold, whether they’re part of the story or just the way you treat people. We chose the righteous path and definitely felt Arthur struggle with his beliefs as seeds of doubt and distrust grew within the gang. You’ll see the world react to your deeds, as certain items may cost less or jobs might pay more. Your honor level effects the decisions you’re given, the side missions you discover, and the finale you get when the long road finally ends.
                                        </br></br>
                                        These parts aren’t the only ways the game forces immersion on the player. There are numerous restrictions that can be a bit cumbersome, but also tie you closer to the world and make you respect the tools you’re given. You have to eat and drink to restore how fast you regenerate health and stamina. Weapons require maintenance, which you can perform manually, or you can pay the gun clerk to service them for you. You have to dress for hot or cold weather or your stamina will be adversely affected. Your horse can only carry a small amount of animals or skins. Plus, you have to figure out which weapons you need to take with you since you can only shoulder two weapons when you’re off your horse, aside from your holstered pistols.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Horses require attention as well since they also have depleting health and stamina. It takes a while to bond with a horse, which will increase its stats and allow you to perform tricks or call it from greater distances. You can brush it, feed it, or pat it to lighten its mood, and agitated horses might be one gunshot or animal attack away from throwing you from the saddle. Missions will give you a horse when you need one, but otherwise, you need to keep tabs on your trusty steed. If it’s too far away, you have to track it down or get back to a stable or camp to spawn it.
                                        </br></br>
                                        These commitments might seem extreme, but they serve a greater purpose. Red Dead Redemption 2 has a very slow and deliberate pace that makes sense considering the setting and story. Comforting a stressed animal, tying rabbits or turkeys to the side of your saddle, or carefully choosing your customized arsenal before a firefight brings you closer to the lifestyle of the era, and Arthur himself. These actions help you build personal attachments to everything, and the small doses of reality never slow things down too much or spoil the experience.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Fast travel also has its limits. You can take trains and stagecoaches to towns you’ve discovered, and you can purchase the ability to skip to a location directly from your bedside, but you can no longer zip to somewhere from a campfire on the open road. Campfires instead now allow you to craft special types of ammunition and cook meat you find while hunting.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The extra riding required to get everywhere leads to some of the game’s most rewarding and spontaneous moments. Animal parts you collect from hunting can be used to upgrade your inventory space, create stat-boosting trinkets, feed the gang, or net you extra cash. Strangers, and other random events, pop up constantly. These might open up new types of items to go searching for, give you a chance to adjust your honor meter, or alert you to other means of making money. You’re free to help, rob, loot, kill, or ignore these people as you see fit.
                                        </br></br><img src="../resources/images/games/promo/red-dead-redemption-2-promo2.jpg" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2 Promo Photo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        Different gangs also occupy each area. They’ll hassle you or the locals and set up traps for you to spring on the trail. Dead Eye returns to help you pick off targets in slow motion, but now there’s also Eagle Eye for gathering plants, searching for clues, and tracking beasts. All the info you acquire is stored in a compendium, and certain memories are preserved in Arthur’s journal. It’s satisfying to fill in each part of the map and discover new towns, but things are still happening in places you’ve already visited and surprises keep popping up even after the end credits roll. If you need a break from the outlaw life, you can play an assortment of card and dice games, see a live show or movie, or bring in a bounty and partake in that set of unique stories and colorful characters.
                                        </br></br>
                                        This world is alive with people to meet and animals to find, and your methods of interacting with them are impressive, but the game’s visuals transport you to another time and place more than anything else. The customization options with your weapons, clothing, and horses are of the highest quality and they’re easy to obsess over. Hair takes time to adjust as you have to grow it before you can cut it. The lighting has clearly received special attention, particularly when rays from the sun cut through foggy forests, rain dumps down, and lightning crackles in the distance. Likewise, towns become illuminated with a soft glow against the heavy darkness of night. Fire appears to completely consume certain objects when lit, wood splinters as you use boxes or posts for cover in gunfights, and new buildings are constructed as the story goes on.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Navigating the map is one wow moment after another, and just when you start to get used to how beautiful the game is, it hits you again with another stunning view. Even little animations like when Arthur puts his rifle over his shoulder or tucks it into the saddle give all the elements a satisfying weight and relevance. A first-person view lets you play from a different perspective, and while we didn’t switch to it that often, it is amusing to keep a close eye on people while each scene plays out.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Red Dead Redemption 2 tests the boundaries of interactive immersion. Few games look this good, play this well, and have this much to offer. It begs you to slow down, turn every page of its dramatic tale, and savor every last breathtaking detail. It challenges you to be prepared for anything, and make the right decisions when your choices matter most. Arthur Morgan is the lead, but the world takes center stage to pull you in. With a list of challenges left to finish and an online mode launching soon, we plan to spend a lot more time in Rockstar’s unparalleled recreation of the old west.</br>

                                        Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales doesn’t quite reach the heady heights of 2018’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, but that doesn’t stop it from being one of the best superhero games ever made. The price of admission is higher than we’d like – though to have a game of this quality is a rare treat, particularly during the launch of a new console.

                                        The launch of a new console is always an exciting and rightly celebrated event, but it’s rare that a game as good as Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is around to share in the festivities.  
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buowyvVrXYU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        Launch line ups tend to be devoid of big hitters, and often have a habit of bringing gamers’ sky high expectations plummeting back down to earth. While Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is certainly a cross-gen game at heart, the PS5 manages to elevate the experience substantially thanks to its two display mode options, incredibly fast load times and crystal clear 4K visuals. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s a beautiful looking game, then, and a fitting sequel to 2018’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, but it’s more akin to a generous expansion than a full-blown successor – think Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and you’re on the right lines. That means it’s a more condensed experience overall, though no less entertaining. Expect spectacular, jaw-dropping set pieces, Hollywood-rivalling voice acting, and sensational HDR implementation throughout (if you have a capable display).
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Harlem heroics</span></br>
                                        The star of the show is – perhaps unsurprisingly – young Miles Morales. The seventeen-year old New Yorker is instantly likeable and refreshingly... well… just nice. He loves his friends and family, cares about others, and is the type of good-hearted person we can all strive to emulate. In a world where too many loud voices are vying for attention and genuine acts of human kindness are few and far between, Miles' wholesome personality really resonates. There’s no unnecessary bravado or sense of misplaced confidence.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It makes the character all the more believable for it, as Miles learns to juggle his new dual life. Acting as a normal teenage kid while helping save New York as Spider-Man is no easy task after all, even with an excellent mentor like Peter Parker. But Miles also has to cope with less heroic feats, such as adapting to a new environment after moving to Harlem with his mother. The end result is a story that feels engaging from the outset, and is delivered with exceptional presentation values from the very first moments through to the last.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Miles is entrusted with protecting a snow-enrobed New York after Peter heads on a well-deserved vacation, and the events that take place while Pete’s away ultimately help shape Miles into the hero the city needs. However, Miles will also uncover some secrets close to home that will force him to make some difficult, life-changing decisions. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        The game begins in dramatic fashion as you team up with Peter to halt a rampaging Rhino, who's careering through everything that's within his path. It's the perfect introduction to Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and an impressive teaser of what awaits during the game's captivating story. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Steering Rhino through a packed mall while sat atop his giant shoulders is an arresting moment, and the seamless switch between gameplay, quick-time-events and cinematics is achieved with aplomb. It's easy to forget how close video games are to mimicking the best Hollywood has to offer, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales only helps drive home that the gap continues to diminish. 
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Come out swinging </span> </br>
                                        <span>"Booting Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales takes mere seconds thanks to the PS5’s super-fast SSD, allowing you to jump into the game at breakneck speed."</span></br>
                                        Just like in Marvel’s Spider-Man, the moment you take control of Miles Morales as he takes his first swing through the bustling city is a spectacular thrill. The difference the PS5 makes is immediately apparent, too, with impressive draw distances, far more densely populated streets and ray-traced reflections all catching the eye. 
                                        In fact, you feel the benefit of Sony’s new hardware as soon as you start the game. Booting Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales takes mere seconds thanks to the PS5’s super-fast SSD, allowing you to jump into the game at breakneck speed. You can also bypass the main menu entirely and jump into specific challenges from the PS5’s home screen, which are displayed as Activity cards. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        While it would be a stretch to say that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is something that only the power of the PlayStation 5 could provide (remember, a version of the game is headed to PS4, too), this a gorgeous-looking title regardless of the extra graphical flourishes. The biggest benefit that the PS5 version brings is the aforementioned ray tracing, which brings realistic lighting and reflections to the game, instead of the usual smoke and mirrors that we’ve been used to. You’ll get to see Miles’ reflection in an office block as you swing past, for example, and while that might sound like a small addition, its impact is quite impressive. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Textures and material work are also worthy of praise. Everything from the glistening sheen of Miles’s Spider suit to the bobbly bits of wool visible on worn jumpers look extremely convincing, and it really adds an extra level of fidelity. Character models are a bit hit and miss, though, and a clear reminder that Spider-Man Miles Morales is essentially a super-charged PS4 game.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Venom extract</span></br>
                                        <span>"Diving off the edge of a vertigo-inducing building only to fire out a web just before you scrape across the asphalt is simply exhilarating."</span></br>
                                        Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales puts you in the figure-hugging suit of the younger web-slinging hero who, naturally, brings his own unique abilities to the table. His Venom moves are the obvious highlight, surging a yellow electrical current through certain attacks, but Miles also feels more nimble than his mentor Peter Parker. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Not only are Venom moves spectacular to look at on a HDR display, they’re also extremely enjoyable to pull off. You can smash through stubborn enemies and perform some shockingly effective crowd control techniques using Miles’s new found powers. Oh, and you can also turn invisible for a short period of time, making stealth sections far more forgiving. It’s enough to make the original Spider-Man’s abilities seem pretty generic by comparison.
                                        </br></br>
                                        While Miles is still learning what it takes to be Spider-Man, and the responsibility that entails, you’re not necessarily hampered by his rookie hero status. Your skills can be upgraded and improved over time of course, much like Miles’s array of Spidey gadgets, but the game re-treads many gameplay mechanics from 2018’s smash hit.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The free-flowing, combo-chasing combat system that was successfully pioneered by Batman: Arkham Asylum remains intact, complete with more calculated sections that see you pick off enemies one by one using various traps, distractions and, of course, sticky spider webs. While we still think Arkham Asylum and subsequent Batman games do a better job in representing how enemies react to their colleagues being neutralized one by one, it’s still incredibly satisfying when you bundle up a bad guy in a webbed cocoon or knock out a hapless foe with a well timed trap.
                                        </br></br>
                                        You’ll need to utilize all of Miles’s move set to overcome the various types of enemies in the game, of course. Some require that you lay the smack down aerially, while others will need softening up with a few Venom attacks. Each enemy type poses a different challenge, and learning how to approach each encounter is the key to success. Combat continues to be engaging, if a tad familiar, and can pose a stern challenge at higher difficulty levels, though we did find the camera to be problematic at times.</br>
                                        Traversal is arguably Spider-Man: Miles Morales most enjoyable gameplay mechanic, though. Diving off the edge of a vertigo-inducing building only to fire out a web just before you scrape across the asphalt is simply exhilarating. You can shoot yourself forward at a moment's notice, perform aerial tricks as you freefall towards the ground and take in snowy New York in all it's glory as you fly through the air. Fast travel is available, but swinging through the city is so engaging and perfectly captured that it honestly never gets old. There's just so much joy to be had in simply being Spider-Man. 
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Marvellous modes</span></br>
                                        Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is hopefully the first of many PS5 titles that give players the choice of how they want to play, and there are now three modes to choose from after the game received a new update: Fidelity, Performance and Performance RT. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Fidelity is the default setting and features graphical settings like ray-tracing, enhanced lighting and additional effects. It uses temporal techniques to provide the best image quality possible, but you’re locked at 30 frames per second. Performance mode, meanwhile, does without these graphical enhancements and upscales to 4K from a lower base resolution. Performance RT mode keeps ray tracing and 60fps, but reduces the resolution to around 1080p, lowers the reflection quality and reduces pedestrian density. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        While ray-tracing is certainly an impressive graphical effect, offering realistic reflections and lighting that simply wouldn’t have been possible on the last generation of consoles, we found ourselves gravitating towards the game’s Performance or Performance RT modes thanks to its numerous benefits. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Spider-Man: Miles Morales is at its best when you’re leaping off skyscrapers and zipping over the bustling New York streets below – a higher framerate keeps the onscreen action looking silky-smooth and allows all the world’s detail to shine.
                                         </br></br>
                                        Input latency is also reduced when opting for 60fps, making combat feel more fluid and responsive when you’re beating up bad guys. We also found that animations appeared more life-like as a result of the higher framerate mode, even without the lack of graphical flourishes found in Fidelity mode. We didn’t experience any noticeable drops or hitches, either, which has often been the case with Performance modes on the last-gen PS4 Pro, that weren’t really worthy of the name.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Power in your hands</span></br>
                                        One element that did disappoint, however, is the game’s use of the PS5 DualSense controller's feature set – or lack of. Swiping left on the touchpad brings up the game’s app, but the use of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers is rather uninspiring, and didn’t really delight us as much as we initially hoped. You can feel slight tension while web-swinging in the triggers, which eventually loosens once your web snaps. It’s novel, then, but hardly as impactful as we'd hoped.
                                        Though the game’s main story clocks in at around 10 to 12 hours or so, there’s plenty of content to enjoy after the credits roll. From traversal, combat, and stealth challenges to accepting side quests and preventing crimes using the game’s 'Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man App', there’s enough content to justify the game’s slightly steep price tag.
                                        Side quests are thankfully more than just "travel from point to a to point b" affairs, and you’ll be rewarded with tokens that can be used for upgrades upon their completion. There’s enough variation to keep things interesting, too: one mission sees you saving a store owner’s cat, while another will have you scanning an underground network of pipes to help restore a local food shelter’s water supply. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Collectibles are also scattered across the city and include things such as mementos from Miles's childhood and mini-challenges that help flesh out the games backstory and characters. Most involve reaching a specific destination to seek them out, but again, because traversal is so satisfying, the journey there is part of the appeal.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Verdict:</span></br>
                                        With so many superhero films being pushed back because of the pandemic, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is comfortably the best action blockbuster of this year. While we wouldn’t consider it a must-have game to show off the power of the PS5 – honestly, Astro’s Playroom does a far greater job of showcasing the potential of Sony’s new console and controller – it’s yet another excellent PlayStation exclusive that will have fans of other consoles eyeing Sony’s system with envy.
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>A Beautiful, Terrible Sequel</span></br>
                                        There is much to admire in Naughty Dog’s ultra-dark revenge video game The Last Of Us Part II. And there is much to critique. The devs who poured their blood, sweat and tears into the game deserve praise for its technical achievements. The writers who mangled the story deserve the lumps that follow.</br>
                                        Despite its gore and violence, The Last Of Us Part II is a beautiful game, with renditions of post-apocalyptic Seattle and Santa Barbara that are simply staggering in detail and scope. The sights and sounds of this game are lush and lovely, gruesome and harrowing. In terms of presentation, The Last Of Us Part II is easily one of the best of the generation.</br>
                                        Meanwhile, the acting is—without exception—phenomenal throughout. Ashley Johnson as Ellie turns in another fantastic performance, with a great deal more of the spotlight this time around. Troy Baker’s Joel has a much smaller role, but he’s as good as ever. And man, both these two are just insanely talented. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        Laura Bailey, who plays the third main character in the game, Abby, is also excellent. Sure, her character is fairly loathsome, but Bailey is great.
                                        Alas, while the game is gorgeous to look at and listen to, and the acting is as good as any I’ve ever encountered in a video game, it falls apart when it comes to both gameplay and story.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The first game didn’t have much going for it in the gameplay department, either—neither game is particularly strong as an action/shooter, and each forces players to spend far too much time tediously picking up odds and ends in order to craft bombs and med-kits, and ammo for your routinely empty firearms. (There’s a setting that makes this somewhat less tedious in the sequel). When it comes to gameplay, both games are fine. Just fine. Not great, not terrible. Just fine.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPNiIeKMHyg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        But the first game’s lacklustre gameplay was more than made up for by a compelling story filled with complex characters in a gritty, intriguing post-apocalyptic world. It didn’t hurt that it also had one of the best endings in video games, period.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It was an ending that deserved to be just that—the end of Joel and Ellie’s story, unresolved and bittersweet. Brittle and precarious and powerful all at once. A happy ending in many ways, but an unsettling one, too.</br>
                                        Joel’s was a lie told out of love, but it was still a lie. He kept that secret for the same reason he rescued Ellie from the Fireflies. Because he couldn’t stand to lose his daughter. Not again.
                                        </br></br>
                                        That same lie kicks off the events in The Last Of Us Part II, but it quickly runs roughshod over everything we loved about the first game, trampling even our high opinions of the protagonists in the process. What follows is a too-pretentious-by-half story of nonsensical revenge and relentless violence. It masquerades at depth and meaning but fails to deliver either.
                                        Better to leave us hanging than take us down this wallowing, nihilistic path of despair and misery porn. Unless you get off on that sort of thing, of course.

                                        <span>An Unnecessary Sequel</span></br>
                                        Unfortunately, The Last Of Us Part II only follows in the original’s footsteps in the most generic ways. Chronologically, it comes after the first game and it takes place in the same post-apocalyptic America. In every other sense, it may as well be a completely new franchise. At least then it wouldn’t have so badly damaged the characters we came to know and care so much about in the original.</br>
                                        In the original, Ellie is a teenage girl who is the only person immune to the strange virus that’s caused this spore-based zombie apocalypse. Unlike every single other human, bites and spores don’t turn her into a monster. We don’t know why.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Joel, who lost his own daughter tragically at the outset of the apocalypse, is tasked with bringing Ellie to the Firefly scientists where they hope to use her to find a cure. The Fireflies are freedom fighters. They’re here to help. Or so we’re led to believe.</br>
                                        Along the way, throughout the course of the game, Ellie and Joel become like family. It’s not an easy road, but they manage it together and in many ways Ellie becomes the daughter Joel lost, dragging him out of his long malaise and giving him something to believe in and to fight for. She’s spunky and funny and tough, and she awakens a new sense of purpose in the burned out, grizzled survivor.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In the end, when Joel and Ellie finally find the Fireflies, it turns out that the group isn’t all they were cracked out to be. The doctors are unethical murderers who decide that it’s just fine to sacrifice the one living person who is actually immune to the disease in order to create a vaccine (a completely absurd, anti-scientific, anti-medicine decision that exposes the Fireflies for the atrocious bastards they really are).</br>
                                        Joel decides that sacrificing a young girl to save humanity is absolute crap and rescues her instead, killing some of the guards and doctors in the process. He does what every father would do in this situation—and what every ethical human being ought to do.</br>
                                        There is only one correct answer to the question “How many lives would you sacrifice to save humanity?”.</br>
                                        Your own. Only your own. It’s one thing to take life in order to save someone; it’s another to sacrifice an innocent in the hopes that you’ll save someone. So Joel takes lives in order to save an innocent. It’s unfortunate that he is forced to kill, but he couldn’t stand by and let it happen, either. He had no other ethical choice.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Even if—and it’s a very, very big if—her death would have resulted in a vaccine, allowing it to happen would be cruel and immoral. And a doctor, above anybody else, should realise this. Certainly in our own fraught times we should understand just how tricky coming up with a vaccine is—and killing the one specimen that may hold the answer is not only cruel and immoral, it’s magnificently stupid.</br>
                                        Joel lies to Ellie about it after the fact, telling her that it didn’t work, she wasn’t the answer. And off they go, riding into the sunset.</br>
                                        It’s the perfect ending. In my head-canon, I’m just going to pretend it’s the only ending.
                                        </br></br>
                                        When Naughty Dog announced a sequel, creative director Neil Druckmann revealed that it would be a game about hate. The first was a game about love, the second hate. Like the tattooed fingers of Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter.</br>
                                        One might wonder at this point, why you’d really even have to separate the two. Light is the left hand of darkness; love is the left hand of hatred. The first game had its fair share of hatred, after all. Unfortunately, the sequel really doesn’t bother much with love. When it does, it’s at its very best, but those moments are few and far between.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The first big problem with The Last Of Us Part II’s story is that there is very little about it that justifies its existence. It picks up a few years later, though there are flashbacks of the intervening years scattered about the game. We learn quickly where Ellie and Joel currently stand in their relationship. While the story itself is told in bits and pieces, jumping to different timelines, the basic premise is this:</br>
                                        Ellie has discovered that Joel lied to her and she’s mad about it. She’s mad that Joel didn’t let the Fireflies kill her in order to create a vaccine. She’s still mad at him when Abby, the daughter of the chief Firefly doctor, tracks down Joel and brutally murders him, exacting a ridiculously brutal revenge for her father’s murder. And right here, right in this one short paragraph, there is so much wrong that my head hurts even typing it out.
                                        </br></br>
                                        First of all, the game seems to want us to think that Ellie is right and justified in her anger and that Joel is in the wrong. Not just about lying but about him saving her in the first place. The game suggests, in so many different ways, that Joel’s actions were selfish and wrong. There is an implicit sense, throughout the story, and especially in the way it attempts to empathise with both its angsty emo female leads, that we should accept that Joel was wrong. That his actions were somehow immoral.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But Joel was not wrong. The doctors who decided to throw out their entire ethical and moral codes by sacrificing a young girl in the off-chance that they might come up with a cure were wrong. Ellie is wrong to suggest that a person who loves and cares for her should simply stand by and watch as she’s murdered. That’s preposterous. Any parent knows this. Any parent would do the same thing as Joel. And any doctor worth a damn would never harbor such intentions, no matter how many zebras they save from barbed wire.
                                        </br></br>
                                        But in The Last Of Us Part 2, the doctor who decides to kill Ellie is portrayed as a good man who helps escaped zoo animals and loves his daughter. And his daughter, Abby, is somehow portrayed as justified in her brutal killing of Joel, and setup as an “equal” to Ellie in the game, given just as much (if not more) screen time by the time the credits role.
                                        I’ll get this out of the way right here: Abby’s revenge plot was deeply stupid from the start. At first, I didn’t even realise that this was the avenging daughter of the Firefly doctor because of how thin that rationalisation would be. She doesn’t just kill Joel (who saved her life moments earlier, by the way) she makes him suffer. She wants it done slowly. And she does it with the support of a bunch of other people who, throughout the course of the game, are humanised and presented as sympathetic characters rather than the despicable monsters they are. (Later, Abby shows Ellie mercy despite her having killed several of those friends, which is kind of weird given the lengths she went to kill Joel . . .)
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/the-last-of-us-part-2-promo2.jpg" alt="The Last Of Us : Part 2 promo" class="feature-two-promo">
                                        It’s one thing to get revenge because you watch your surrogate father beaten to death with a golf club, bloody and crumpled on the floor. It’s another to get revenge because someone killed your own murderous father while rescuing an innocent girl who he was about to kill.
                                        I mean, really? I get that you’d be upset that somebody killed your dad, but when the reasoning is “he was saving his daughter from certain death” that sort of takes the wind out of those vengeance sails, doesn’t it? Maybe if not for Abby, then for her compatriots who might, given a moment to think about it, consider Joel’s actions self-defense. And sure, you might want revenge, or you might shoot the guy if you run into him and act in a moment of pique, but tracking him down and then making him suffer while beating him to death with a golf club when you’re fully aware he did it to save his daughter? Give me a break.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I’m just trying to puzzle out what kind of person goes this far out of their way to get bloody vengeance like this. A pretty evil person. Abby is evil right from the start. But the game and its creators don’t want you to think that. They want you to spend half the game empathizing with Abby. The other half of the game they want you to lose whatever respect you had for Ellie.</br>
                                        The Last Of Us Part II already makes it clear from the outset that we should have very little respect for Joel and his past choices. Then, instead of creating a sympathetic antagonist in Abby, they make her about as evil as possible and then ask us to see things from her point of view. It doesn’t work. The real victim of all of this is Ellie, however. I used to like Ellie quite a bit, but not by the time I finished this game.
                                        So the whole game gets off to a rough start. It doesn’t get better from here.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Ellie and Abby are the two playable characters in The Last Of Us Part II. You play as Joel for a few minutes before he’s bludgeoned to death. In many ways, he’s the lucky one. At least we get to remember him as the caring father who saved Ellie and stuck by her through thick and thin. The game can try to convince us that he was in the wrong, but we know better. Joel is spared the next agonising 25 to 30 hours, minus some flashbacks which are its finest moments (and a good template for what this game could have, and probably should have, been).</br>
                                        Ellie’s “death” is much more tragic, because the game proceeds to ruin her character in every subsequent scene, thoroughly destroying any semblance of who she once was and turning her into a relentlessly selfish, murderous jerk. All because somebody thought that a story about a cycle of revenge would be more interesting than a story about wandering through an abandoned museum.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I bring that up because to me, the museum bit was the most powerful piece of storytelling in the entire game. In a flashback, Joel takes Ellie to a surprise. She tries to guess what it is along the way, and the two banter back and forth like the good old days.</br>
                                        The surprise is an abandoned museum. The first thing you see is a giant T-Rex outside its doors, and if you’re the exploring type you discover that you can climb up its back and leap off its head into the pool below. Maybe you do this two or three times just because it’s so light and breezy and you desperately need a break from grim and awful. It’s such a cool bit of storytelling. It’s so at odds with the rest of the game.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Once inside the museum, Ellie and Joel explore the displays. There are various dinosaurs and astronaut suits, and even an old rocket ship which you can go into and imagine you’re taking off into outer space. You find an old Indiana Jones hat (a little nod to Uncharted) which you can toss onto one of the dinosaur’s heads. It’s imaginative and beautiful.</br>
                                        The sequence takes a dark turn in the end, and that juxtaposition of whimsy and terror makes it by far my favorite part of the game. Joel and Ellie are still a team. They have some great bonding moments. There’s some laughs, a good scary bit and it’s done. I wish the entire game had been like this. Moments of beauty and moments of ugliness woven together in a kind of bleak harmony. Some contrast, some variety.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Instead, it’s a game about two young women trying to kill one another, while everyone around them also tries to kill each other. You stab and/or break so many necks by the time it’s over, you start to feel a bit numb.
                                        It’s a game about hate and don’t you dare forget it.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Let’s Not Bicker And Argue Over Who Killed Who</span></br>
                                        After Joel’s vicious murder, Ellie feels like crap. She wants revenge and so does Tommy, Joel’s brother. He sets out first and Ellie sets out a bit later, accompanied by her new girlfriend, Dina. Halfway through the game, you go back in time to when Ellie and Dina arrive in the city, but you play the next few days as Abby instead, seeing things through her eyes. This is an odd choice given how thoroughly we despise Abby at this point, and it never stops being an odd choice. While some of her story is interesting, she really isn’t. She’s a one-note character who, beyond being a murderer, does really crappy things to people she cares about. Abby sucks. A lot.</br>
                                        In Seattle, two factions do battle as Ellie and Abby traverse the city, Ellie searching for Abby to get revenge, while Abby looks for her wayward ex-boyfriend, Owen. The Wolves and the Seraphites (nicknamed the Scars) vie for control of the city.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The former is a group of former rebels who shook off the yoke of a tyrannical post-apocalyptic government and set up their own quasi-fascistic organisation. Only now with burritos! They’ve taken in Abby and some other former Fireflies, like Owen. (They’re not a couple anymore, but Abby and Owen have sex in the game despite Owen’s current girlfriend being very, very pregnant. Because Abby is the worst).
                                        The Scars, meanwhile, are a fanatical cult-like group—the kind that shows up in video games like this and in TV shows like The Walking Dead. They’re kind of like The Whisperers from AMC’s zombie drama, as in they’re so over-the-top it’s completely immersion-breaking. The game’s writers must have thought they were crafting a realistic post-apocalyptic group, but the Scars come off as cartoonishly vile and utterly preposterous.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Also, the Scars shoot arrows that are far more deadly than the most powerful gun in the game, so that’s a neat trick.</br>
                                        Suffice to say, the Scars are a completely implausible group that cartoon-ifies the sequel in ways that simply didn’t happen in the first entry. There were some very bad people in the original Last Of Us, but I never rolled my eyes the way I did with the Scars.</br>
                                        In any case, most of the game—after the opening and before the final act—takes place in Seattle across a three day period. Ellie and Dina arrive in Seattle and start tracking down Abby. During that same period, Abby explores the war-torn city and we see how the Wolves vs Scars war plays out.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Thus begins a story of revenge and violence in which Ellie stabs a couple hundred men and women in the jugular a few times and Abby breaks countless necks. Between the two of them, Ellie and Abby must murder a few hundred people, but of course only Joel and Abby’s father’s deaths warrant retaliatory bloodshed. All those other deaths? No big deal.
                                        Oh, and when you kill someone and another AI bad guy finds their body, they’ll call out the deceased’s name like it means something.
                                        “No, not Timothy!” “They killed Kenny!” “Brenda!!!”.</br>
                                        It’s another little touch that’s designed to make the game’s world and people seem more real. It doesn’t work. At all. Hearing Generic Bad Guy call out the name of Dead Generic Bad Guy only made me chuckle and roll my eyes. I’m coming for you next, pal. This shiv’s for you!</br>
                                        We have the same half-dozen enemy character models repeated over and over again throughout the game, but I’m supposed to feel something—some sense of guilt, perhaps?</br>
                                        Not hardly.</br>
                                        I mean, the game doesn’t even give you a non-lethal option and stealth mechanics are severely limited so why not just murder everyone?
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/games/promo/the-last-of-us-part-2-promo3.jpg" alt="The Last Of Us : Part 2 promo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        <span>The Slog Of Slogs</span></br>
                                        Meanwhile, pacing is a mess. The Last Of Us Part II drags on far too long with too many encounters, too many dramatic moments and too much redundancy. I’d take a game half the length with just a few more interesting set-pieces to replace all the endless slaughter.</br>
                                        There are a few named characters Ellie finds and kills as she tracks down Abby, and at least one of these encounters has oomph (when Ellie discovers that she’s killed a pregnant woman, having just found out about Dina’s pregnancy) but largely this sense that we’re supposed to feel bad for all this killing feels more like something Naughty Dog is hammering into us rather than part of a well-crafted story.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I watched a bit of footage I’d captured the other day where Ellie stabs this guy in the neck four or five times and it’s just gross. It doesn’t make me feel bad it just feels completely gratuitous. I simply don’t care about any of these people I violently murder in The Last Of Us Part II, and honestly, neither does Ellie. That may be the real problem with the game’s violence. It doesn’t square with the game’s seriousness or flimsy attempts at some kind of message.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s so nihilistic so much of the time, you get the sense that there is no message. Nothing learned, nothing gained. No meaning to be found, even when you get to the dregs.</br>
                                        Yes, we get a sense that Ellie is traumatized by all the violence. When Abby let’s her go for a second time, despite having just killed everyone Abby cares about (and despite Abby having proven already that she’s the vengeful type so this mercy makes no sense whatsoever) we follow Ellie and Dina and Dina’s new baby to a farmhouse where they’ve cobbled together a new life together. But what appears to be all peaches and sunshine falls apart when Ellie has a bad flashback. Tommy shows up and chastises her for not killing Abby. So Ellie gives up her nice little life and sets off again, to try to kill Abby again.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Because Ellie learns nothing in this game. She must have left behind two hundred corpses in Seattle, including all of Abby’s friends, but that’s not enough to sate her thirst for comeuppance, and she doesn’t realize, bafflingly, that it will never be enough. Revenge won’t bring Joel back and it won’t assuage her guilt at how she treated him and it won’t lead to a life of happiness.</br>
                                        But off she goes to California.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Many people who aren’t super-fans of Naughty Dog were incredibly upset by the game’s ending. So was I, but for somewhat different reason. We’ll get to that in a second.</br>
                                        After her stint at the farm, Ellie abandons Dina and the infant they were raising together to once again seek out Abby, this time in Santa Barbarra. It’s just another way the game makes you hate Ellie. Her pettiness, her bitterness, her endless self-obsession and selfishness. That the game feels it necessary to have Ellie try for revenge once, fail, and then go out again is pretty ludicrous from a narrative standpoint, not only extending the game for no good reason—it’s about ten hours too long—but making Ellie out to be even more unsympathetic in the process.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In any case, Ellie ditches Dina (who deserves better, quite frankly) and the child and heads to Santa Barbara. It’s a great location, all sun and heat compared to Seattle’s rain and gloom; orange and yellow instead of green and grey. Once again, Naughty Dog proves that it can craft some truly jaw-dropping environments. Your first moments in Santa Barbara are wonderfully scary and tense.</br>
                                        But once again we have another group of wicked bastards to contend with. This group is called The Rattlers. The Rattlers aren’t as psycho as the Scars, but they’re close. They keep slaves and crucify troublemakers down at the beach. In Naughty Dog’s apocalypse, life truly is nasty, brutish and short. Psychopaths and creepy cults are everywhere.
                                        </br></br>
                                        This group must have sounded good on paper but to me the Rattlers are just more cartoon villains for us to stab and shoot and blow sky high, this time with a silenced SMG in your arsenal. There must be a more nuanced take on the apocalypse that all these game and TV show studios could come up with, one in which people are complicated, and groups of people aren’t always so different from one another. But so far, only the Jackson, WY settlement seems to be comprised of real people with actual shades of grey.
                                        I’d say that Naughty Dog tried to make Abby and the Wolves complex, too, but they kind of botched that when they had them murder Joel in the very beginning. Every subsequent attempt to humanize Abby and her co-conspirators falls short thanks to that misstep.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In any case, back to Santa Barbara.
                                        The sequence starts with Abby and her companion Lev searching for the Fireflies in Santa Barbara. We met Lev back in Seattle. He and his sister were Scars, but they were cast out and were going to be killed when Lev cut his hair. Lev, we discover, is biologically female but wants to identify as male, and the uber-religious Scars think this is an unforgivable sin. It’s a pretty ham-handed attempt at tackling the issue of trans people and tolerance in the game, simply because the Scars are so outlandishly awful. But Lev is a good character and Lev and Abby’s relationship is the one point of redemption in Abby’s entire arc, and one which I wish Naughty Dog had handled almost entirely differently. More on that later.
                                        Abby and Lev are looking for the Fireflies so they can rejoin Abby’s old group, and just when they’ve made contact over the radio they’re ambushed and taken prisoner by the Rattlers. You can tell right away that these are Very Bad Dudes.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Sometime later, Ellie shows up, following the lead Tommy gave her back at the farmhouse. She discovers the Resort and this new enemy faction after creeping through some very zombie-infested buildings. One thing this game does do very well is make the various spore zombies scary, as much through their terrifying warbling and screeching as anything. Naughty Dog’s sound design is matched only by their graphical prowess. Nobody can discount just how technically and artistically this game succeeds. It’s the writing, the narrative, where everything falls apart.
                                        And we come, at long last, to the ending.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>This Is The End, Beautiful Friend</span></br>
                                        Depending on how you play, you either sneak or blast your way through the Resort area until you free some prisoners and they tell you that Abby has already been taken and punished for trying to escape. So you head to the beach as the prisoners go to battle with their former captors (or what’s left of them after Ellie cleaved her bloody path through their ranks).</br>
                                        She walks down to the beach. It’s dark. The sounds of combat echo in the distance. The sea is draped in fog. Abby and Lev, along with countless others, are hanging from posts, basically crucified and on the verge of death, skeletal from starvation. It’s as grim and awful as anything we’ve seen up to this point.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s just that we’re all so very, very numb by now. Another fresh hell stuffed into 30 hours of grimdark violence, atrocity and betrayal. A powerful moment that needed to come much, much sooner. (Honestly, they should have scrapped California entirely and had Ellie find Abby strung up by the Scars in Seattle).</br>
                                        Still, it’s probably the first time I felt real sympathy for Abby. No matter how much of a monster she was—a faithless friend, a brutal killer, a small-minded ruffian—it’s tough to see even your worst enemy starved, hanging from a post, dying slowly. And Lev was innocent. He didn’t deserve this fate. Nobody does.
                                        </br></br>
                                        When Ellie cuts her down, and Abby carries Lev to a boat to make good their escape, and it looks like Ellie has finally realized that revenge really doesn’t make anything better, I was actually pleasantly surprised. There is a beauty in mercy. Even Abby showed mercy—not once, but twice—to Ellie, after all.</br>
                                        Abby is not a sympathetic character and nothing the game tries made me like her, but I do want to like Ellie. Ellie taking revenge on Joel’s killer might feel good, but Ellie showing mercy makes her more human. It makes her a better person. It means that after all this blood and death and hate, she could come out the other side as someone who has grown and changed and run the gauntlet of suffering and still come out the other side with her self intact.</br>
                                        If she had simply turned around and left her to her fate, I could have accepted that ending as well. It would have been more cruel and Ellie would have been less humanized by it, but at least it would have been a decisive and powerful ending.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Or if Abby were already dead, there would have been some poetic justice to that as well. Ellie’s hands would be clean. Well, not clean exactly but cleaner. I’ve heard it said those damned spots don’t come out.</br>
                                        But instead, Ellie cuts her down. And they go their separate ways, not friends or allies, but united in suffering and tragedy. An end to the cycle of violence. Something like resolution, however bitter and incomplete.
                                        Only, no, not quite. We need some mud-wrestling, don’t we? We need to see the women get down and dirty. We need that sweet, sweet misery porn.</br>
                                        What follows is the single worst moment in the entire game (aside from forcing us to play as Abby for fifteen hours of it, or the total character assassination of Ellie). Instead of cutting her down, showing mercy, Ellie decides that actually she still needs to get revenge. Wouldn’t want all that stabbing practice to go to waste, right?</br>
                                        She’s going to stab this woman, who has been starving to death hanging from a pole, until she bleeds out and dies. Only, not really. Nope. She’s going to stab and slash her a few times and then let her go again.
                                        Fun times. This is really how I want to spend my video game time.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Have Mercy</span></br>
                                        Now, a lot of people are angry that Ellie didn’t end up going through with it, that she spared her sworn enemy. They hated Abby and think that a satisfying ending required Abby to die, and Ellie to kill her. I think that’s rubbish. Sure, it could have worked in different circumstances. If Ellie and Abby had met on equal terms, for instance. But this “I’m going to save you and let you live, oh never mind time to die, oh never mind again you can live” nonsense is just bad writing.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Revenge can be fun. John Wick does “fun revenge” very well. I remember watching Braveheart for the first time and William Wallace’s revenge was thrilling. But the moral of the story in serious works of fiction is that revenge is bitter (not bittersweet) and never quite plays out the way you’d hoped. It creates a cycle of violence that hurts everyone caught up in its wake. Hamlet is consumed by his desire for revenge—prompted by the ghost of his father—but in the end it just means that everyone dies, including innocents like Polonius and Ophelia and, though she’s perhaps a little less innocent, Hamlet’s mother as well. Revenge, like that green-eyed monster, jealousy, is dangerous. Something to be avoided if at all possible. Even justifiable revenge—think A Time To Kill—can lead to all sorts of problems.
                                        </br></br>
                                        What this game needed in the end was grace. The kind of strange, unsettling thing that comes over someone when they suddenly realize something profound and choose to take a different path. When Ellie sees her emaciated enemy hanging from a poll and, instead of feeling gleeful satisfaction, feels only horror and pity, she acted with grace and mercy and, in that moment, became the person we hoped she would become. It was never about killing Abby. It was about Ellie finding her own redemption.
                                        </br></br>
                                        And then they throw it all away.</br>
                                        Two angry, beat up, half-dead murderesses slicing each other over and over again in the shallows, blood and saltwater spraying everywhere, until suddenly Ellie gives up and let’s Abby go. Again. I’m not one to usually criticize games for their violence, but this felt exploitative to me. And redundant. All that potential for mercy and grace lost.
                                        Ellie already let her go! She already came to the conclusion that she should let Abby live when she cut her down! Why go through all that again? Why have this horrible, violent, senseless slasher fight if, at its conclusion, Ellie simply let’s Abby go again?</br>
                                        The ending could have worked with mercy or revenge as the outcome, but apparently the writers had trouble making up their minds about which direction they wanted to go, and decided to try and have their cake and eat it, too. The result feels sloppy, repetitive and frustrating.
                                        More than anything, this game’s ending needed to not beat around the bush.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Either cut her down and let her live (mercy) or have Ellie take revenge (leave her to die) or have her already dead when Ellie gets there (chance). You can’t have it both ways, all ways, whatever. If you want to end the game with a knife fight, do that. But don’t make Ellie cut her down first. Have them meet as equals. It’s too much like Indigo Montoya helping the Man in Black up the cliff just so he can kill him. Only not in the least bit funny.</br>
                                        The last scene, when Ellie returns home to an empty farmhouse, Dina and her baby long gone, is better. A fitting reward for Ellie’s selfish, self-destructive obsession with revenge.</br>
                                        A game about hate, sure, but even more a game about loss.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</span></br>
                                        Not everything about The Last Of Us Part II’s story was terrible. I loved all of Ellie’s flashbacks with Joel and Tommy. I might have even enjoyed Abby’s if her character deserved it.</br>
                                        As I noted further up, I also very much enjoyed the sights and sounds. Graphically, few games I’ve ever played can compare. For all its violence and misery, The Last Of Us Part II is a true beauty. Sound design, though, is what really makes it scary. When the game bothers trying to be scary it succeeds more often than not.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Gameplay gets bogged down at times by the lack of a full-fledged stealth system and somewhat dense AI, but there are still some exhilarating sequences and combat, while far from my favorite, can be tense and exciting. There’s simply too much of it, like there’s too much of just about everything here. Too much crafting, too much scavenging (though remember there’s an option to make that more tolerable), too much story and too many hours of game to get through.
                                        </br></br>
                                        For all my complaints—complaints I genuinely found made me dislike this game and everyone in it more and more the longer I played it, and the longer I stewed over it after—I still had something resembling fun while playing. I finished the damn thing, which is more than I can say for a lot of games.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I also really enjoyed the entire frightening intro sequence with Yara and Lev, and those characters in general. If only Abby had had some sort of dawning realization about Lev and her relationship with Lev made her better understand Joel’s actions. She could have let go of some of that hate. If Abby had realized that protecting Lev from Isaac and the WLF was basically exactly what Joel was doing by rescuing Ellie from her dad and the Fireflies (only he knew Ellie a lot longer) we might have actually had a story with some interesting dynamic character arcs.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Actually, the more I think about it, the more I wish that The Last Of Us Part II had never been about Joel and Ellie at all, and that the entire thing had been the story of Abby and her desire for revenge and how that transformed into understanding and forgiveness for her father’s killer as she grew into the role of protector and surrogate mother for Lev. She could have found empathy along the way, and chosen to spare Joel’s life, sparing Ellie her own story of revenge and horror, and saving all four characters in the process.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Perhaps a game about hate could have turned into a game about love, after all.
                                        </br></br>
                                        P.S. This was a strangely challenging review for me to write. I didn’t get a review copy so I was late to actually playing it, but even after I finished the game I had a hard time putting pen to paper. I finished my first draft of this review weeks ago and then found myself unable to come back to it. I’m not entirely sure why.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In one sense, it’s because the game left me with such conflicting feelings. It’s clearly a very good game in many ways, and yet also sort of horrible at the same time. And even though I ultimately found the tale of revenge and violence too pretentious and not nearly as effective as its creators hoped, I was still haunted by it. It had emotional resonance even while not really standing up to scrutiny. So my apologies for the very late review, but sometimes that’s how it goes. Writer’s block is a helluva thing.
                                        </br></br>
