                                            Deathcore upstarts <span>BABIRUSA</span> have made quite the name for themselves in their short existence, positioning themselves as forerunners for the deathcore crown in Australian heavy music. After releasing their first single in mid-2019 and subsequent singles in early-2020, they gained themselves quite a lot of hype, especially considering that the band is made up with current and ex-members of local favourites <span>Tomb of Doom</span>, <span>I, Valiance</span>, <span>A Night in Texas</span>, <span>The Senate</span> and <span>Crowned in Flesh</span>, so understandably there would be a certain amount of expectation that whatever comes out of these guys is going to be undeniably brutal and heavy.
                                            </br></br>   
                                            Their sound is very easily categorized as technical deathcore along the lines of <span>Aversions Crown</span> and <span>Shadow of Intent</span>, with strong elements of technical and progressive death metal intertwined with swathes of melodic death and traditional deathcore with a hint of slam – transitioning from sweep picked arpeggios, palm muted chugs and slams to blast beats and lightning fast drum fills with ease – with an emphasis on crafting intricate, thoughtful and catchy riffs and let’s not forget the use of two vocalists.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2876979559_5.jpg" class="feature-one-img" alt="Babirusa - Humanoid cover"> 
                                            For some reason duel vocal deathcore, or extreme metal in general has been very few and far between – genre luminaries <span>Despised Icon</span> as well as newer bands such as <span>AngelMaker</span>, have proved that it could be done and done well, for whatever reason the trend just never took, but <span>BABIRUSA</span> clearly never got that memo – going from shrill black metal highs to deathcore signature mid-range vocal style to brutal death’s guttural lows, all while exhibiting a song writing and production quality that is at an international level, one would not expect any less from the very capable hands of <span>Sean Delander (Thy Art Is Murder)</span> and <span>Dan Field</span> at the helm, handling production and engineering duties respectively.
                                            </br></br>    
                                            You can’t talk about this album without mentioning its concept – Man vs Machine – Not necessarily a original concept by any means but one that is still incredibly relevant in this day and age, a concept that has transcended generations and all form of media, through books (Dune, The Humanoids, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? etc.), film (The Matrix & Terminator franchises, Blade Runner etc.), television (Black Mirror etc.) and music (Fear Factory etc.)
                                            </br></br>

                                            The first track titled ‘343’ – is a human who is pulled into a cybernetic world by artificial intelligence. Opening with clean guitars and bass with a harmonized lead that builds behind a sample (or a soliloquy?) that asks itself questions of purpose and it’s perceived memories, all while the music grows in intensity until it coalesces and breaks, fading out and unfurling the first single and second track, ‘DESOLATION SYSTEM’, starting off with a quick drum fill and a chugging riff, the two front-men use their extensive range to bounce off of one another, sharing similarities in their individual style yet, playing to their strengths and layering for full effect. But while the vocalists get to show off, drummer Rangi Barnes is in the back, effortlessly keeping the pace and groove while guitarists Tate Senhenn & Dean White seem to do laps of the fret-board culminating in a huge breakdown.
                                            </br></br>                           
                                            Track three, ‘HUMANOID’, continues the narrative with the assistance of another sample, further deepening the dilemma our protagonist is engulfed in, while still contemplating whether or not it is in fact alive, or if it even matters at all. The sample concludes with chaotic, spiralling guitars that sound like what I imagine trepanning without anaesthesia feels like, before launching into an almost djent/groove chug part, transitioning into tech death frenetic fret-board wizardry that would make <span>Necrophagist</span> blush, while Rheese and Kyle continue eviscerate their vocal chords, before breaking into a guitar solo and melodic death-esque riff section that gives me a fair amount of The Black Dahlia Murder vibes, which I really enjoy, a welcome injection of melody in the almost anxiety inducing riffage returns before the massive breakdown, building up and gaining momentum, culminating in a guitar solo and sinister tremolo riff and blast beat section that eventually fades into oblivion.
                                            </br></br>   
                                            ‘CATATONIA’, the third single begins with both vocalists proclaiming “We are the only ones who see the world for what it is!” before the rest of the band joins in, luring the listener into a false sense of security before changing the tempo from a mid-paced groove section to lightning fast tech death, slowing down just enough for a slow, menacing build up allowing you catch your breath and to believe for a second that a breakdown was coming but instead, speeding up even faster than before, until completely slowing down for an epic guitar solo and an almost discordant black metal tremolo riff section, closing out the track with a sample; the continuation of the story leading into ‘REFLECTION’, a short instrumental giving us further insight into the story of ‘343’.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-Yh-IV_7c4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                            Segueing on from track 5 – ‘PENDULUM SWING’, ominous clean guitar strums behind a sample telling the main character, “It’s time to become a part of all things…”, launching into a very catchy groove orientated and bouncy djent chug riff that is sure to get the crowd moving – then putting the foot on the gas with a chaotic riff section that winds and swirls, stopping and starting on a whim, maintaining the groove until crowning with an earth shattering breakdown.
                                            </br></br>  
                                            ‘RESISTOR’ wastes no time, getting right to business, with an astonishingly fast and elaborate riff that would feel right at home on a <span>Deeds of Flesh</span> or <span>Decrepit Birth</span> record, which is just fantastic, Tate and Dean shine especially bright here, the riffs are complex and have a neo-classical quality to them, especially with the quiet choir effect behind them – an accompanying chug part with the appropriate amount of guitar bends for full effect before breaking into a quick jazz interlude that merely stalls long enough to demolish you with an absolutely crushing breakdown, fading out and into ‘ABOMINATION’, the second single maintains a mid-paced tempo and bouncy feel for that keeps up the intensity and groove, while the vocalists execute rapid fire vocal attacks back and forth, Rangi’s drumming is particularly impressive here.
                                            </br></br>                           
                                            ‘DEHUMANIZED POPULACE’ grinds along with vicious chugs, harmonized shrill high pitched screams and Gutturals, eviscerating your senses with a homage to tech death that would make <span>Chuck Schuldiner</span> proud, until the Breakdown hits you like a truck, this one is sure to be a crowd favourite, while ‘ZEROHOUR’, the final outro track, laden with samples and epic guitar harmonies concluding our protagonist, ‘343’s fateful journey of self-discovery and alienation. 
                                            </br></br>
                                            Overall, this is a phenomenal debut album – ultimately a bold choice to do a concept record for your first, but given the experience in song writing that the various members possess, it’s not surprising that they pulled it off in spades. 
                                            </br></br>
                                            Babirusa's debut album 'Humanoid' will be released on Friday August 28th.

                                                The long awaited debut release from Australian deathcore freshman <span>INHIBITOR</span> is here, after months and months of luring us down the rabbit hole with various singles and videos showcasing their own violent brand of deathcore, ‘Abhorrence’ is finally being unleashed unto the world. Exhibiting a strong songwriting quality that can only be contributed to the various members’ abundance of experience in the scene; executing every chord, tremolo, blast beat and growl with the precision and skill of seasoned pros with an undeniable sense of urgency and focus rarely seen in newer bands.
                                                </br></br>

                                                It's hardly surprising with a veteran line-up featuring current and ex-members of local heroes State of East London, Hollow World, Her Majesty, Eater of the Sky & Kontact, these guys are clearly not here to fuck spiders. Their sound could be summarized by fast and aggressive deathcore with strong elements of technical death metal and blackened nuances with an emphasis on precision and mood – with heavy use of Eerie and haunting discordant chords in the foreground giving the songs dark and brooding textures drawing comparisons from deathcore legends <span>Whitechapel</span>, <span>Carnifex</span> & Australia’s own <span>Thy Art Is Murder</span> just to name a few.
                                                </br></br>
                                                The opening notes of ‘LOATHING’, fading in as if awaking from a dream, but not truly awake, the grogginess twisting reality and blurring the line between sleep and death before the rhythmic barrage of chugging riffs and the line “Humanity so hollow, so who will you choose to follow, come fourth my unholy host, our lord of slavery” comes roaring through the speakers, giving the listener a glimpse of the horror that awaits. Drummer, Michael Hodgson’s relentless bombardment of blast beats and double kick seem almost inhuman at times, punctuating the track with a pulsating groove that gives guitarists Samuel Celli-Bird & Daniel McBride as well as Bassist Declan Hain a vast canvas in which to scribe their blackened infused riffs unto. Jesse Burr’s vocals are tight and aggressive in their delivery and the lyrics are thought provoking without relying too much on metaphors to get his point across, but at the same time the proclamation is clear, this track in particular deals with the traps of organised religion and champions the “think for yourself” attitude. Sure to be a crowd favourite, this song hits hard and fast with an angry and urgent energy that will keep the mosh moving from start to finish.

                                                Second track, ‘BERSERKER’ does little to provide the listener with much reprieve, following its predecessors lead and diving straight into fast technical riffs that could have come out of <span>Psycroptic</span>’s playbook – solid grooves spiral and convulse until culminating in a crushing breakdown, this track again showcases Jesse’s impressive vocal range with high shrieks, accented and layered with his brutal mid-range vocal style, and the occasional guttural thrown in for good measure. Lyrically the song heavily criticizes organized religion, specifically the Christian church’s penchant for praying on the weak willed and disenfranchised with false promises and belief systems in exchange for blind obedience and their life savings, some brilliant lines like – “Masked behind our meaningless lives, Bound is the book of lies and sold back to you at a price” & “We’re all alone in the empty dark, Silence provides no solace and answers when you’re faced with the void”.
                                                </br></br>
                                                ‘DEATH’, the second single, released in mid-2020, focuses primarily on the environmental destruction our planet, beginning with a quick sample behind an eerie, discordant soundscape and the opening line, “Welcome to the 21st century, where we kill the earth with such intensity, global temperatures never to recede”, it says it all really; this track speaks of the frustrations of sitting back and watching as our world burns beneath our feet for the sake of greed – accompanied by a fantastic video and some satisfying <span>‘Demigod’</span> –era <span>Behemoth</span> vibes, this could easily be a soundtrack to an apocalypse . With an emphasis on Groove with this mid-paced banger, this will be a staple of their live set for years to come and the breakdown half way through the track is sure to keep the pit warriors more than happy.
                                                </br></br>          <span></span>
                                                The third single, ‘CATALYST’ again deals with the complacency of the human race in regards to the slow death of our planet and its uncertain future all for the sake of greed, with ripper lines like “Mistress of life, why won’t you hurry up and die, let's put on our black ties and bleed her till she’s dry”. Instrumentally, this track keeps the intensity and momentum up, with super catchy and sinister riffs, the dark and brooding atmospherics have a ‘Sons of Northern Darkness’-era Immortal feel to it, Jesse’s mid to low range vocals complementing the diabolical riffs perfectly, while final track ‘DREAD’, featuring the monstrous vocals of <span>Mark Poida</span> (ex-<span>Aversions Crown</span> & <span>I, Valiance</span>), this song packs a hell of a punch, continuing the onslaught with tight, fast and truly evil sounding tremolo riffage that feel like a jackhammer to the side of the head, seamlessly transitioning into intricate Swedish death-esque melodic parts and a superb solo section, one could only imagine the pit swirling and head banging in unison to the absolutely brutal breakdown at the end. 
                                                </br></br>

                                                For a first release, this is a great effort and shows limitless potential, the song writing's on point and hits hard, the lyrics are well written and carry a strong message. The impassioned delivery of every vocal, note and chord is unquestionable, a mere taste of what’s to come. This is a band to keep an eye on for sure.
                                                </br></br>
                                                'Abhorrence' will be released Friday, September 11 2020. Pre-orders for physicals and merchandise bundles available HERE via Bandcamp.

                                        Perth’s <span>Make The Suffer</span> have gone from strength to strength since their inception in 2008, despite line-up changes that would cripple a lesser band, their sound has continued to evolve - beginning their career with Blackened and Symphonic tinged Deathcore with their 2012 debut <span>‘Neverbloom’</span> before incorporating more Progressive and Metalcore elements and soaring clean vocal melodies into their sound with 2015's follow-up <span>‘Old Souls’</span> and ramping it up with the release of 2017’s critically acclaimed <span>‘Worlds Apart’</span>. 
                                        </br></br>      
                                        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/wallofsoundau.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MTS-funeral.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1" class="feature-one-img" alt="Make Them Suffer - How To Survive A Funeral cover">
                                        The thing that sets MTS apart is their very tasteful use of synths and piano as well as utilizing Sean Harmanis’ impressive vocal range juxtaposed with Booka Nile’s angelic cleans providing a rich and unique sound in a scene that has otherwise felt stale and formulaic in recent years, not to mention Nick McLernon’s furious riffage backed up by Jaya Jeffery’s thundering bass and Jordan Mather’s tight and meticulous percussion, Make Them Suffer have proven that they are force to be reckoned with. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        For their much anticipated forth record, entitled 'How to Survive a Funeral', Make Them Suffer enlisted none other than <span>Drew Fulk a.k.a. WZRDBLD</span> - who has handled production duties for Metalcore heavyweights <span>Motionless In White</span>, <span>Beartooth</span> & <span>Bullet For My Valentine</span> as well as hip-hop luminaries <span>Yelawolf</span> & <span>Lil’ Wayne</span> to help them capture what could truly be their 'Master Of Puppets' or 'White Album' if you will. The growth in the few years of heavy touring since their last release is immediately evident and the band have clearly come out the other side with some fresh sounds to add to their already stacked bag, while still showcasing their trademark down-tuned heaviness, the song writing on display here is a considerable leap forward - assimilating Pop and Post Hardcore elements that bring a brightness to their arrangements while still retaining hints of the melancholy wall-of-noise of their Blackened and Death Metal roots.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwZmtvD-Xgo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        The record begins on a sombre note with the short intro track ‘STEP ONE’ with the opening vocal line <span>“SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART”</span> - which serves as the mission statement of sorts for the record accompanied by a bone shattering breakdown leading into ‘FALLING ASHES’, with a harsh tremolo riff and frantic blast beats that would make Emperor proud - showcasing their sheer heaviness and aggression while still maintaining a groove that keeps you moving before slowing right down with an ominous synth heavy passage, luring you into a false sense of security, then blasting your eardrums one last time before ‘BONES’ kicks in with its rhythmic Progressive/Djent inspired groove and a guttural roar, “I CAN'T BREATHE!”, building into a powerful piano and chord driven chorus showing off Harmanis’ vocal range with some great lyrics - “Shed my skin, take me from my home, I give all I am, I give all I own. Shed my skin, steal my heart again, take from me my bones”, this song will surely be a staple in their live set for years to come. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        ‘DROWN WITH ME’ is a mid-paced banger with solid grooves and guitar bends that build into an anthemic chorus showing off the brightness I mentioned earlier with well-placed piano and strings that has an almost Ballad like feel to it finishing it off with an absolutely monstrous half time breakdown. ‘ERASE ME’ begins with a calming piano intro before blasting your eardrums once again with lightning fast Blackened assault and apocalyptic blast beats, switching to Melodic Death inspired riffage, that harkens back to Metalcore’s glory days, and yet another beautifully anthemic chorus with some really powerful and emotionally charged lyrics - “But you're waiting patiently for something worth saving, I've broken you enough so don't hate me. But you're waiting patiently for something worth saving. Erase me”.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taBVhtPbT5c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        The latest single ‘SOUL DECAY’ is sure to be a crowd favourite, with its mosh heavy riffs and tight grooves, again demonstrating MTS’s affinity for catchy yet crushingly heavy song writing, this song hits incredibly hard not only for its instrumentation but the subject matter of its lyrics - Conjuring up images of the dark side of addiction and watching someone you love succumbing to the pitfalls of that lifestyle (that is my take away from them anyway..).
                                        </br>
                                        ‘FAKE YOUR OWN DEATH’ is easily one of if not THE heaviest track on the album, showing us that MTS is still very capable of writing an absolutely ruthless Deathcore banger - full of breakdowns and in your face pissed off aggression & attitude. The lyrics are straight forward and angry as fuck, I get an old school <span>Slipknot</span> vibe at times in this song which I’m all about. If this song doesn’t get the mosh lords moving then I don’t know what will. When this song comes on, I’ll see you in the pit.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The title track ‘HOW TO SURVIVE A FUNERAL’ opens with a discordant, chaotic riff that that writhes and wails with an almost Southern Rock fury - bearing a slight resemblance to early Norma Jean, before slowing right down and seamlessly transitioning into an piano led section without losing any of its intensity or momentum, led by Booka Nile singing - “You barely knew us. You were out of touch, out of touch for so long. You filled the room up. And none of us knew we cared 'til you're gone”. 
                                        </br></br>
                                        ‘THE ATTENDANT’ takes a step away from the heaviness with this slow Deftones-esque masterpiece, with flourishes of piano accentuating the chord driven riffs and allows Harmanis to shine bright with an impassioned vocal performance beautifully harmonized with Nile the lyrics are melancholic & self-reflective; dealing with self-doubt and depression (again, my take away from it), this song seems quite far removed from the rest of the album sonically, but is in fact a culmination of the quieter moving parts of their arrangements forming a cohesive piece resulting in an absolutely powerful song that is one of my favourite songs on the record.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xr2ZfoABjws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        If we haven’t learned our lesson by now, it’s too never underestimate Make Them Suffer’s ability to take its audience by surprise by throwing a curveball with it’s final track, ‘THAT’S JUST LIFE’, with its electronic drum beat intro like a thumping pulse, getting the blood pumping again after slowing it down to a crawl - we are greeted once again by the “heavy” MTS. Groove laden riffs and bouncy rhythms, bleeding into an earth shattering breakdown, synth infused clean vocal passages and fretboard traversing guitar solo brings this beast of an album to a close, leaving you breathless and wondering what the fuck just happened. After listening to this album a few times, its many twists and turns still come as a surprise.
                                        </br></br>
                                        A common theme of this record I feel is the concept of growth, and this album shows much growth, not just as musicians but as songwriters, and of course as people –  no longer obsessed with just writing the heaviest record or song as possible for the sake of it, but crafting a work of art. And this album is just that. Make Them Suffer have created something incredibly special. They should be very proud. And you should listen to it.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Germany's <span>DEFEATED SANITY</span> are set to take the Brutal Death Metal world by the throat and drag it’s rotting corpse through the cobble stone lined streets of Berlin with the release of their sixth record, <span>‘THE SANGUINARY IMPETUS’</span>. Diverging ever so slightly from the Groove & Slam driven material of 2016’s <span>‘Disposal of the Dead // Dharmata’</span>, in favour of the decidedly more Technical and Progressive writing style of their 2013 opus <span>‘Passages into Deformity’</span>.
                                        </br></br>              
                                        I’ve followed Defeated Sanity for many years from a far, and have always appreciated their versatility as purveyors of the more debauched style of Death Metal - whereas Brutal Death Metal is often seen as the less sophisticated cousin of the aforementioned sub-genre of Extreme Metal, these savvy Germans bring some welcomed flavours to the dinner table for us to feast with ever changing tempos and time signatures and virtuous musical abilities that feels like controlled chaos is about to unfurl and drag us all into the abyss.
                                        </br>
                                        Of their 20+ years in the underground scene, Drummer/Multi-Instrumentalist <span>Lille Gruber</span> (who also serves as Guitarist on the record), joined by Bassist <span>Jacob Schmidt</span> & Vocalist <span>Josh Welshman</span> have shown considerable and obvious signs of evolution and maturity in their sound; never making the same record twice, they have proven to be true masters of their craft, constantly pushing the limits of extremity and technical prowess.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1076321780_10.jpg" class="feature-one-img" alt="Defeated Sanity - The Sanguinary Impetus cover">
                                        Opening this absolute beast of a record is ‘PHYTODIGESTION’, beginning with a rather anticlimactic and solemn snare and a kick, slowly gaining momentum, building to the first of many ungodly Blast beats, coupled with a frenetic Progressive riff section that evokes almost instant anxiety and tension, while a descending Bass tapping section that seems to just heighten the stress, threatening to spiral out of control. Lille Gruber’s Jazz influences shine through here with some well executed drum accents and tight fills, all the while vocalist Josh Welshman appropriately shreds his vocal chords with some of the lowest and most defined Gutturals I’ve ever heard, the transition from the lightning fast BDM into the slower slam breakdown towards of the end is flawless.
                                        </br></br>                  
                                        ‘IMPOSED CORPOREAL INHABITATION’ doesn’t fuck around either, bludgeoning would be the most appropriate word to use when describing this track (let alone the entire album!), the drumming is particularly impressive here, fills & blasts intertwine with sickening Bass & Guitar riffs and arpeggios in a perfect marriage of Brutality and Technicality. Taking a more straight up Death Metal approach to the riff structures that bring to mind <span>‘Covenant’</span> era <span>‘Morbid Angel’</span> meets <span>‘Effigy of the Forgotten’</span> era <span>‘Suffocation’</span>, with an emphasis on Groove that keeps the tracks momentum moving forward before ending abruptly.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5iAhavRVbg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        The respite is brief as the beginning of ‘CONCEIVED THROUGH SAVAGERY’ almost seamlessly segues from the previous track, showing off DS’s superb writing skills. Keeping the same pace throughout, barely letting you up to catch your breath until the very end, slowing down just enough to lure you into a false sense of security, only to bludgeon you once more, ending with an echoing war cry before ’ENITITY DISSOLVING ENTITY’ continues the attack with constant tempo changes - Slowing to a mid-paced Groove, picking the pace back up then slowing down again culminating in a crushing Slamming breakdown.
                                        </br></br>
                                        ‘INSECTA INCENDIUM’, the first single released for the album, brings back the chaotic wall of sound that Defeated Sanity’s own brand of Technical Brutal Death Metal is known for - flourishes of beauty writhing amongst the filth - never shying away from the head banging slam riffs, transitioning from technical to straight up brutality with ease, from mid paced to frighteningly fast in the blink of an eye, ’ARBOREOUSLY TRANSFIXED’ follows suit (I get <span>‘I, Monarch’</span> era <span>‘Hate Eternal’</span> vibes here). The almost cinematic feel of this record is akin to a Movie soundtrack - dynamic and relentless in its vision, albeit a soundtrack to an entire franchise of Horror films along the lines of <span>Hostel</span> or <span>Saw</span>.
                                        </br></br>

                                        The second single ‘PROPELLED INTO SACRILEGE’ though, feels like its own stand-alone track, with the first actual break between songs with expertly executed arpeggios and tremolo driven guitar and bass parts with relentless blasts that seem inhuman. The fact that drummer Lille Gruber serves as not only Drummer but also lead Guitarist for this record is mind blowing, his writing is phenomenal, this makes for a very cohesive writing style that takes into account of everything when constructing a record as Technical as this.
                                        </br></br>
                                        ‘DRIVELLING PUTREFACTION’ & ‘DISLIMBING THE OSTRACIZED’ are the longest offerings on the record and together almost form one very long epic song split into  two, the former is much slower in pace compared with the rest of the material found on this record, and for good reason, its pace feels intentionally subdued, a purposeful foreshadowing of the absolute beldam that is about to erupt, slowly building to the ultimate conclusion until finally the latter - the final track unleashes a barrage of sinister riffs and blast beats. Tempos and time signatures convulse and atrophy, culminating in the most crushingly brutal breakdown I’ve heard probably ever.
                                        </br></br>
                                        A very well written and well thought out album, it does indeed have a Soundtrack quality it, I’d recommend listening to it as a whole, though every song on its own hits hard, the true power to this record lies in its ability to form one cohesive piece, which speaks volumes on the bands vision and ability.

                                        Scotland's <span>Bleed From Within</span> up the ante with the release of their fifth record, <span>‘Fracture’</span> - Without exactly reinventing the wheel when it comes to a modern take of extreme metal, but they do take massive step forward creatively by effortlessly transitioning from Technical and Melodic Death to Groove Metal to classic Metalcore without it sounding contrived or forced.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The first single and first track on ‘Fracture’, 'THE END OF ALL WE KNOW' wastes no time with long, drawn out cinematic intros, and jumps  straight into a ripping Melo Death riff that wouldn't feel out of place on an early <span>Soilwork</span> or <span>In Flames</span> records, before slowing to a mid-paced groove then taking a hard right turn with a breakdown that could only be described as the best homage to <span>Decapitated'</span>s <span>'Sphere of Madness'</span> I've ever heard - the chorus on the other hand is anthemic and catchy as hell, taking me back to the mid 2000's Metalcore with an impassioned vocal delivery and uplifting subject matter really make this song a stand out.
                                        </br></br><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rocksins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bleed-From-Within-Fracture-Album-Cover.jpg?fit=800%2C800&ssl=1" class="feature-one-img" alt="Bleed From Within - Fracture cover"> 
                                        The  Melodic Death and Thrash influences are worn proudly on their sleeves with tracks like 'PATHFINDER' & 'FALL AWAY' - Frenetic fretboard acrobatics, solid grooves and Scott Kennedy's vocals shifting from the mid-low growls to an almost Southern metal vibe with a healthy dose of <span>Slayer</span>-isms to keep you moving or headbanging or arms crossed, standing at the back of the room, nodding occasionally or whatever you do to enjoy your metal - with more sing along chorus' to keep the crowd chanting and filthy breakdowns to keep the pit monsters sweating.
                                        </br></br>              
                                        'INTO NOTHING' gives the listener a slight reprieve from the breakneck speeds with a mid-paced groove driven track and second single, the catchy, rhythmic breakdown towards the end of this song really gets me going (I get an awesome 'One Kill Wonder' era 'The Haunted' vibe here). The title track 'FRACTURE', begins on a somber note with haunting spoken words  and a powerful chord driven chorus that was made for epic crowd sing a longs, with great lyrics to boot, before launching into a seizure inducing riff section, that wouldn’t feel out of place on an <span>Architects</span> record, but BFW make it squarely their own.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The third single, 'NIGHT CROSSING', opens up with a melodic lead with a meaty bass tone that builds into a heavy chorus (I get hints of early <span>Killswitch Engage</span> & <span>As I Lay Dying</span> here) before sidestepping into a calming acoustic guitar section with a guest spot from <span>Trivium</span> frontman <span>Matt Heafy</span>, who rips a typically epic solo, finishing with a crushing breakdown.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtOX0dQ9Sac" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        'FOR ALL TO SEE' is another mid-paced offering that hits hard but ultimately falls a tad short, losing a bit of momentum and seems to serve as more of a prelude to, ‘ASCEND', which brings back the intensity and sense of urgency in not only music but also in the vocals and lyrics that hit hard like  - "I watch the sun drain through the cracks in the sky. I'll let you burn for all our hope was denied. Watch as the sun drains through the cracks in the sky. Return to bone, ascend into the night", with catchy as fuck riffs, bouncy mosh parts and sing along chorus' a plenty, this will sure to be a crowd pleaser.
                                        </br></br>
                                        ‘UTOPIA’ and closing track ‘A DEPTH THAT NO ONE DARES’ chugs and shreds, stacked with more groove infected melodic riffs and the occasional dip into dissonant black metal tremolo picking and blast beats with chest thumping breakdowns.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3CSbg-1OUg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        Although the album does follow the familiar structure of verse-chorus-breakdown-verse-chorus at times - but  they do so sparingly and tastefully while also leaning into their strengths in writing dynamic songs with catchy riffs, that hearken back to the glory days of Swedish death influenced Metalcore with uplifting lyrics and plenty of mosh worthy moments to keep the crowd happy.
                                        </br></br>

                                            Slamming Deathcore veterans WITHIN DESTRUCTION, are set to change the game with the release of their much anticipated third record ‘YŌKAI’, marking a drastic departure in sound and aesthetic, and given their history for ‘tongue in cheek’ humour, you’d be forgiven for thinking, is this for real? And if so, will it be any good? The answer is simply: Yes.  
                                            </br></br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5dDFG3mr0g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                            Eight years in the making, from their early days as Melodic Deathcore upstarts with 2012’s ‘From the Depths’, then taking a massive leap forward musically with 2016’s ‘Void’, propelling them into the global spotlight, becoming a hit with young Slamming Deathcore fans the Internet over, and solidifying their rightful place on top of the heap with the release of 2018’s ‘Deathwish’, alongside peers <span>Vulvodynia</span>, <span>Slaughter to Prevail</span>, <span>Signs of the Swarm</span> etc. – but the 2020’s ‘YŌKAI’ marks a change in the guard, not merely content with sitting still and repeating themselves, WD are determined to carve themselves a path, on their terms.
                                            </br></br>

                                            Handling the bulk of the production of the record themselves and putting it out on their own Label, ‘Ultra Heavy Records’, beginning with the promotional photos and teasers leading up to the release of the first singles and its accompanying media with over the top and brightly coloured, neon Anime imagery and a departure from their defining sound, adding welcome splashes of vibrant colour to their palette, as well as an unlikely shade– Trap Rap. Hip-Hop and Metal have had a checkered past to say the least – one could say a love/hate relationship, but splicing Slamming Deathcore, Metalcore and Trap probably shouldn’t be done, but WITHIN DESTRUCTION have achieved  the impossible, thy made it sound good! This move may alienate some fans in the process but gain many more, as well as possibly start a movement and a sea of imitators and naysayers alike. 
                                            </br></br>

                                            Starting the album off with a short intro track, ‘YOMI’ with its slow bass heavy Trap beats and tranquil Koto – a traditional Japanese string instrument plucked sparingly in the background, gradually, building up until the title track ‘YŌKAI’ kicks in, full of bouncy groove-laden Metalcore chug riff that evokes comparisons to bands like <span>Wage War</span> & <span>After the Burial</span>, and a cheeky Slam breakdown, then mid-way through the band takes a hard left turn and slows the song right down and evoking ‘Architects’ vibes with the assistance from <span>Crystal Lake</span>’s <span>Ryo Kinishita</span>, ending the song with a ‘lesson’ in expert level Slam Breakdowns.
                                            </br></br>      
                                            ‘HARAKIRI’ begins on a slightly sombre note – eerie, ominous beats with vocalist <span>Rok Rupnik</span> whispering “Kill yourself, Kill yourself” over and over, then blasting our senses with brutal gutturals, blast beats, Slamming guitars and confronting, straight to the point lyrics like “No one gives a fuck about your life so step up and make a choice for yourself, or be a slave in a herd of sheep…”, that gives you an idea of what motivated the band to step so far outside of the box and collaborate with rapper <span>BILL $ABER</span> and experiment with new sounds and textures. And in their own words – ‘Don’t be a pussy-ass motherfucker”.
                                            </br></br>

                                            On tracks like, ‘NO WAY OUT’, ‘MALEVOLENT’ & ‘KINGS OF DARKNESS’, the band seem to be in their element, these songs bare a sound that closely resembles what they had already perfected with their previous records, especially on ‘Deathwish’ – a slight tip of the hat to their earlier material while still looking forward but never straying too far from their new found musical blueprint. While still full of Mosh worthy riffage, solid Grooves and some of the tightest drumming in the scene, with the occasional Trap infused spoken word bridge to break up the crushing heaviness and Slamming Breakdowns scattered throughout.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Likewise on cuts like ‘ALONE’, ‘HATE ME’ & ‘BACKSTAB’, the band wear their Metalcore influences on their sleeve and opt for a much more mid-paced tempo & Groove orientated approach to their song writing, while still dipping their toes ever so slightly in familiar territory with frenzied blast beats and Guttural vocals. ‘NO MERCY’ dives headfirst back into Brutal Deathcore territory with chaotic guitars and machine gun blast beats.
                                            </br></br>

                                            ‘B4NGB4NG’ featuring rappers <span>TYOSiN</span> & <span>KAMIYADA</span> perfectly blending Heavy riffs and with Beats and Sub drops in the unadulterated amalgamation of Deathcore and Trap, while instrumentals ‘SAKURA’ , featuring guitarist <span>JASON RICHARDSON</span> and final track, ‘TOKOYO-NO-KUNI’ head into Progressive Metal territory, showcasing just how talented Guitarists Francesco Filigoi & Howard Fang as well as Drummer Luka Vezzosi and just like the Intro track with its bass heavy trap beats and tranquil keys. Although it feels like Trap and Deathcore shouldn’t work, they make it work. Fantastic album.

                                        While most of the hip-hop universe spent last week breathlessly debating <span>Chance the Rapper</span>’s event album <span>The Big Day</span>, that record was quietly outsold by an act almost completely off the radar of the general public: Michigan rapper NF, whose The Search became his second consecutive No.
                                        </br>
                                        1 album. NF has cemented himself as the biggest Christian rap star since Lecrae, and yet even with a No. 1 pop song under his belt—his sentimental 2017 crossover hit <span>“Let You Down”</span>—he’s a ghost to most of the secular world. Rap radio doesn’t play him. The music press barely acknowledges him.
                                        </br></br>

                                        It’s no mystery where NF’s following comes from. He’s a lyrical, white, and Christian rapper in an industry where all three identities can provide a fast track to a devoted audience.
                                        </br>
                                        It doesn’t hurt that he models himself after perhaps the most successful white rapper of all time: <span>Eminem</span>, whose brooding persona and twisty delivery NF copies with the reverence of a 16th-century Japanese painter replicating the masters. Like Eminem, NF draws from his traumatic childhood, never shying from ugly thoughts or inner demons. And like Eminem, he’s from the technical school of rap, where the height of artistry is cramming as many syllables and as much internal rhyme into each bar as possible, nuance be damned. The only real daylight between the two is that NF doesn’t swear.
                                        </br></br>
                                        NF also shares Eminem’s shrillness and distorted sense of volume, rapping like he’s putting on the world’s loudest Punch and Judy show. He spends much of The Search darting in and out of an overbearing rappity-rap snarl-yell that can cut right through you if you don’t relate to his roiling anger. “Last year I felt suicidal, this year I might do something different like talking to God more,” he roars on “Change,” as the track unleashes sheets of <span>Imagine Dragons</span>-esque thunder, swelling like a gospel song. Later, “I Miss the Days” makes the gospel connection explicit with an actual choir.
                                        </br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnlJw9H0xAM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        The Search is a dark record. NF may be a Christian rapper, but his primary muse is misery, not faith, and although he uses too many words, he doesn’t mince them: His struggles with mental illness are life-threatening. On “Hate Myself,” he pictures himself in hell, where he belittles his own corpse: “You ain’t nothin’ but poor and weak.” On “Leave Me Alone,” he’s undone by obsessive-compulsive thoughts, like a character in an Edgar Allen Poe story.And on “Like This,” “Trauma,” and a few other somber tracks where he isn’t scream-rapping, NF begins to sound less like Eminem and more like <span>Mac Miller</span> circa Swimming, maybe the last major rap record that was this blunt about its creator’s longing to escape his suffering.
                                        </br></br>
                                        And like Swimming, listening to The Search induces a feeling of powerlessness: How are we supposed to respond to an album that often reads like a suicide note? At least some listeners are finding comfort in this music. On a Reddit forum dedicated to the rapper, a small community of fans post about how seen and comforted NF makes them feel, sharing hopeful memes and heartfelt testimonials. If nothing else, it’s a relief to see that something constructive has come from his pain. But the considerable chunk of the listening public that remains unaware of NF’s music may want to stay that way. The Search is an unpleasant ride.

                                            This is a fight. You are smaller, weaker, less prepared and about to be totally overwhelmed by a larger and far more vicious opponent who has the firm intent to, no, WILL, destroy you. This is what it felt like listening to <span>Alpha Wolf</span>’s new album <span>‘A Quiet Place To Die’</span>. Words like “smother”, “crush” and “dominate” came to mind upon hearing this fury of an album. The sophomore release from the Melbourne 5-piece is a self-professed step-up from their 2019 EP ‘Fault’, feeling like they’ve finally found their emotional, musical and energetic groove. Having already released three singles from the album to a rousing cry for more, the album truly shows that they’ve taken the lessons from the past and are now kicking them in the teeth!

                                            Within the opening seconds of <span>‘A Quiet Place to Die’</span>, you get the feeling that you’re in for something sinister. This feeling proves to be correct, being delivered violently in the form of the teeth-gnashing vocals and driving guitar riffs that have made Alpha Wolf the personification of their namesake. By the time you get to the first single from the album, <span>"Akudama"</span> (meaning villain in Japanese), you’re already exhausted. Well, too bad, ‘coz this one’s coming for you! The chaotic distortion of angry-bees-style guitar, running snare drum transitioning to heavy toms, then culminating in vocalist <span>Lochie Keogh</span>’s opening line of “Watch the bodies drop!”, show us exactly why this one is described by the band as “the most Alpha Wolf song [they’ve] ever written”. All this is smashed into your face within the first 8 seconds.

                                            "Rot In Pieces" is as chaotic a song as you might find in the genre, with the low end bass and guitars forcing you to feel it right in your chest, then expertly contrasted with fast and chaotic drumming, feeling like you’re trapped in a hurricane inside a room. Even the album’s “slower” song and most recent single, "bleed 4 you", bursts in like an angry lover out for vengeance.
                                            </br></br>
                                            "Ultra-Violet Violence" is a bouncing, charging anthem of a song and sure to get the crowd moving (looking at you, people who start circle pits), while <span>"Restricted (R18+)"</span> shows off the bands musicianship with lightning fast guitar riffage, relentless, pulsating drums and a big ol’ <span>“BLEGH!”</span> straight from the rage centre of the brain! (It’s the amygdala for those interested, which shall now be known as the BLEGH! centre of the brain).
                                            </br></br>
                                            
                                            The band have taken what they’ve done in the past and, like any good creature who evolves, made themselves smarter, harder and with sharper teeth! Production wise, Alpha Wolf have brilliantly managed to make the dirty sludge of guitars sound razor sharp, teetering on the edge of harsh but adding to the ear-piercing yet all-encompassing power of this album. Whilst the drums and vocals will be right up in your face, they will each give you just enough room to breathe…..but only for a second.

                                            Maybe when the next <span>Doom</span> game comes out these guys can do a collaboration with <span>Mick Gordon</span>. It’s like a big ol’ heavy metal bear hug, only you’re wearing a straight-jacket.

                                            For fans of: Polaris, if they got shanked in a street fight, then spent the next 2 years getting prison yard swole just to exact revenge on the guy that did it. Yeah, THAT sort of swole!

                                            <span>Logic's retirement album No Pressure is a back-to-basics palate cleanser</span>
                                            </br></br>
                                            The project details fatherhood and the pitfalls of rap stardom.
                                            </br></br>
                                            After <span>Logic</span>released his first mixtape, <span>Young, Broke, & Infamous</span> in 2010, it didn’t take long for him to establish himself as a can’t-miss prospect — a kid from Maryland who used his tremendous technical gifts to inject a flashy, ‘90s revivalist spirit into his aspirational raps modelled after contemporaries like J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar. Yet his emergence as a global superstar during the second half of the decade coincided with a pronounced creative slump, which culminated in the spring of 2019, when he put out two of the year’s worst albums in any genre: Supermarket, a catastrophic alt-rock detour, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, a study in punchline rap that somewhat resembled Sideshow Bob milling around in a parking lot filled with rakes. Those two releases possessed as much flavour as a cardboard sandwich, and none of the charm of his early work.
                                            </br></br>

                                            Logic’s retirement album, No Pressure, is a much-needed corrective, a back-to-basics palate cleanser that rights the ship with help from co-executive producer No I.D., who was the guiding hand behind his debut record Under Pressure. It’s the cleanest album he’s ever made. 
                                            </br></br>
                                            Sequels tend to settle on top of the original volume like stratified layers of sediment. No Pressure is less of a continuation to Under Pressure than a reiteration, with Logic treating his 2014 studio debut — along with its futuristic 2015 follow-up, The Incredible True Story — as source material to be mined, revived, and sampled. For Rattpack day ones, No Pressure is a treasure trove of Easter eggs. 
                                            </br></br>
                                            During Logic’s hardscrabble youth, he faced homelessness, his siblings sold crack, and his parents battled drug addiction. Under Pressure was about hip-hop as a refuge that helped Logic endure and escape this bleak world. On No Pressure, he revisits these themes at length — “Open Mic” simulates his first performances, and “A2Z” includes an actual rough demo from 2005. The album comes alive through Maryland nameplaces and recollections of his life before his career took off: “Took the 61 to Germantown and hear them guns bust,” he raps on the intro, “Call it static, my headphones on, it's Illmatic/ On my Rosa Parks, in the back writing like B-Rabbit”.

                                            No Pressure is an open tribute to Logic’s myriad influences, which he has always worn on his sleeve. He shouts out Cowboy Bebop and scores a personalized cameo from the Metal Gear Solid character Solid Snake. He borrows cadences from Biggie and Kendrick and makes lyrical nods to Cole and Kanye. He offers “A2Z” as a humble, somewhat half-assed tribute to Papoose’s “Alphabetical Slaughter”.
                                            </br></br>
                                            In contrast to the trap-forward Bobby Tarantino mixtapes, No Pressure generally sits on a bed of crisp, down-the-middle boom-bap inflected with R&B. By recycling production elements from Erykah Badu’s “Didn’t Cha Know,” Lupe Fiasco’s “Gold Watch,” and Outkast’s “Elevators,” (as well as the iconic horns from “SpottieOttieDopaliscious”), it carries the looser air of a true, old school-style mixtape. The event of Logic’s retirement both contributes to this lightweight feel and creates the kind of natural stakes that haven’t existed on any of his prior albums. 
                                            </br></br>

                                            The lowest moment on No Pressure is when Thalia, the Midnight Marauders-inspired robot, opines, “Actually living your life is exponentially different from just being alive.” Fortunately,  these kinds of fake-deep adages are far outnumbered by Logic’s lucid insights into the nature of fame, which has nearly ruined him. “I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered/ I'm constantly second guessing if my profession is worth it on my mental state,” he raps on “Dark Place.” The album’s backwards gaze dovetails neatly with his eagerness to retire; it represents an attempt to “have some fun [on some] back in the basement type shit,” to recreate the days when writing raps was an act of joy rather than obligation.
                                            </br></br>
                                            
                                            The birth of Logic’s son (as well as his lucrative new streaming deal with Twitch) offers a natural exit point from the rap game and all the baggage that comes with it. “Got a son now, f--k the rap game, i’m done now,” he raps on “DadBod.” While any retirement notice from a rapper should be taken with a grain of salt, No Pressure possesses an unexpected grace and restraint that makes Logic’s decision appear all the more compelling, convincing, and necessary. His hyperbolic career arc necessitated a swift exit to a quiet life of child-rearing, gaming, and binging anime. Don’t expect him to pick up the mic anytime soon.

                                        <span>Bring Me The Horizon – ‘Post Human: Survival Horror’: cyber-punk energy meets lockdown metal</span>

                                        The Sheffield rockers are following last year's genre-exploding triumph 'amo' (which crash-landed at Number One) with a series of gnarly, experimental EPs.
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Bring Me The Horizon</span> don’t give a fuck what you think about them – we established that long ago. When the long-fringed Sheffield lads emerged from <span>MySpace</span> in the mid-’00s with their stylised take on Deathcore, they were ripe for a whipping from cynics and trolls. With their thick skin came a shamelessness that fascinated both fans and haters, and kept the spotlight on the band as they moved through genres and rose up the charts until they finally hit Number One with their most palatable album, 2019’s genre-exploding <span>‘amo’</span>.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Many bands in their shoes would use this opportunity to go full Coldplay with a radio-friendly album primed for mass communication, but not Bring Me. Instead, they’re releasing four EPs across the next year, all themed around how humanity is totally screwed. The first in the <span>‘Post Human’</span> series is lockdown metal</span>
                                        <span>‘Survival Horror’</span>, a protest record written in the misery of lockdown.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Opener ‘Dear Diary’ is a snotty thrash metal account of the combo of fear and monotony that comes with entering lockdown (“<span>The sky is falling, it’s fucking boring / I’m going braindead isolated,</span>” howls frontman Oli Sykes), before the dark and trance-y <span>‘Parasite Eve’</span> beckons in a doomed new age “when all the king’s sources and all the king’s friends don’t know their arses from their pathogens”. As the record rolls through the motions of anger, resilience and a little hope for the future, the sentiment feels all too familiar.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AolstL1_MhE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        There are some familiar sounds on there too. That song’s pure aggression harks back to the heavier vibes of 2008’s <span>‘Suicide Season’</span> and 2010’s <span>‘There Is A Hell’</span>, while the rousing emo-rock of <span>‘Teardrops’</span> could have appeared on 2015’s <span>‘That’s The Spirit’</span> and <span>‘Itch For The Cure (When Will We Be Free)’</span> picks up where the trancier moments of <span>‘amo’</span> left off.
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5uV3gmOH9g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        Still, there’s enough new territory here to keep it feeling fresh, not least for the poptastic collaborations: <span>Yungblud</span>‘s pop-punk battlecry elevates the anti-establishment <span>‘Obey’</span>, <span>BABYMETAL</span> bring some J-pop exuberance to <span>‘Kingslayer’</span>, <span>Nova Twins</span> revive nu-metal for <span>‘1X1’</span> and <span>Evanescence’s Amy Lee</span> brings some regal poise and breathing space to the closing ballad, <span>‘One Day The Only Butterflies Left Will Be In Your Chest As You March To Your Death’</span>.
                                        </br></br>

                                        What could have been an act of self-sabotage or self-indulgence – or both – has transpired to be a welcome reminder of all that this band does best, rooted in raw relevance for today and the cyber-punk energy of tomorrow.
