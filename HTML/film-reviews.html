                                        <span>Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are joined by lookalike daughters to party on through time and save the world, with the help of Mozart, Hendrix and Louis Armstrong</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        Bizarre encounters … Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter in their third film journey.
                                        Not excellent maybe, but by no means bogus either, this cheerful Bill & Ted threequel brings the story of our two laidback heroes up to the melancholy autumn of their middle age.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gPGeAYo3yU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        Alex Winter is Bill – and he’s eerily the same – and Keanu Reeves is Ted; though with that dark mop of hair framing his now rather Easter-Island-stern face, Ted looks more forbidding to me, as if carrying the baggage of Neo (from Matrix) and hitman John Wick. But with his weirdly lovable awkward gestures, Ted clearly still has no idea how or why to move his arms. Like the other two films, this is written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, and the director is Dean Parisot, renowned for the sci-fi comedy classic Galaxy Quest.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Bill & Ted was always the non-stoner stoner franchise, a comedy high only on its own absurdity and sweetly serious idealism: as ever, it reminds me (in the best possible way) of a kids’ TV show by someone like Bob “Rentaghost” Block – something to put alongside Doctor Who and Wayne’s World. George Carlin, who played the boys’ cosmic time-travel guide Rufus in the first two films, died in 2008, and makes a virtual-reality appearance here courtesy of archive footage; Kristen Schaal plays his daughter, Kelly.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Nowadays, Bill and Ted are getting on in years, and their band, Wyld Stallyns, has suffered a cataclysmic loss of popularity. The apples of the men’s respective eyes are their music-mad twentysomething daughters, each of whom has effectively been given the name of their dad’s best friend: Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine). This crossover further seals their friends-for-life dedication. Each young woman is of course weirdly similar to her old man, a single-joke mannerism that restricts these performers a fair bit.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The terrible crisis arrives when Bill and Ted are summoned into the distant future by Kelly, and informed by the universe’s Great Leader (an amusingly imperious Holland Taylor) that they have to compose a great track to bring the world together and prevent the destruction of space and time. The boys, sublimely confident that they can do it, but unwilling to go through the faff of actually doing it, simply decide to time-travel forward to the point when it has been done and snatch the composition from their future selves. As Bill declares to Ted: “You have had many counterintuitive ideas over the years, but this is the counterintuitivest of all.” But the Great Leader has an alternative plan to save the world, simply to kill Bill and Ted, for which she has trained a neurotic robot assassin called Dennis, channelling Douglas Adams’s Marvin the Paranoid Android — a nice turn from Anthony Carrigan.
                                        </br></br>

                                        Bill and Ted’s wacky adventures and bizarre encounters with their own variously transformed selves run in parallel with the attempts of Thea and Billie to assemble their own universe-saving supergroup on their dads’ behalf. They travel back to the 1960s and recruit Jimi Hendrix (DazMann Still), to the 1920s to pick up Louis Armstrong (Jeremiah Craft) and then to 18th-century Salzburg to enlist Mozart (Daniel Dorr).
                                        The choice of classical musician here is surely a missed opportunity: Hendrix was renowned for living next door to the London house once occupied by GF Handel and, asked by a newspaper about it, he famously replied: “To tell you the God’s honest truth I haven’t heard much of the fella’s stuff. But I dig a bit of Bach now and again.” But of course the most powerful musician of all is the Grim Reaper from Bergman’s Seventh Seal, first encountered in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey — funny stuff from William Sadler.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s amiably amusing, and Bill and Ted’s Peter Pannish inability to accept the ageing process is enjoyably surreal, with a weird tinge of not-entirely-intentional tragedy. The failure to give Weaving and Lundy-Paine anything really funny to do is a problem; but all the cast are likable, and it’s a sweet-natured journey backwards and forwards down memory lane.
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>Daniel Radcliffe is a gamer drafted into a deadly real-life "game" in a movie that itself is much more like a video game than anything else.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        “Have you learned nothing from video games?” asks one character during a momentary lull from noisy mayhem in “<span>Guns Akimbo</span>”. It’s the wrong question for this movie, whose makers have clearly learned from little else. Those wanting to kiss a few brain cells goodbye may enjoy this bombastic, crassly jokey action cartoon with <span>Daniel Radcliffe</span> as a dweeb who finds himself unpleasantly designated a new player in the unsimulated kill-or-die game he’s been watching online.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/guns-akimbo-promo1.jpg" alt="Guns Akimbo promo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        Anyone with an attention span above ADD levels, however, is likely to find this undeniably slick, energetic contraption plays somewhere between grating and numbing. <span>Jason Lei Howden</span>’s Kiwi-German co-production should do a bit better than last year’s vaguely similar TIFF-premiering enterprise “Nekrotronic,” but it still seems primarily a streaming item.
                                        Radcliffe’s Miles is a stereotypical 21st-century nerd living alone in an action-figure-crammed flat, whose only girlfriend is the ex he’s still stuck on (Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Nova), and who’s bullied by a frat-bro boss at his job working for a company that specializes in cheesy video games for kids. His major emotional outlet is watching the notorious “Skizm,” a real-life “death match” between a rolling cast of “weirdos and criminals,” shot live by drones, followed by a growing audience of vicarious-thrill seekers. The reigning champion is Nix (Samara Weaving), a Harley Quinn type who’s played a major role in racking up the numerous fatalities to date that have police frantic to stop this public bloodbath.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOFatKD0Vzo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-2"></iframe>
                                        Miles gets into the roid-raging spirit of the thing by applauding each bullet-riddled kill, while sparring with equally bloodthirsty trolls who clamber online to gloat. His bravado behind the safety of a keyboard attracts the wrong kind of attention, so that one day he finds several Mad Max rejects breaking down his apartment door to smack him around. Once he regains consciousness, he discovers major weaponry has been painfully bolted to his hands — rendering them extremely awkward for anything else, such as opening a door or having a wee — and that he’s the new opponent of highly lethal Nix.</br>
                                        The rest of hyperactive “Guns Akimbo” is pretty much all bang, splat and boom, a nonstop chase with frequent gaming and text-messaging graphics onscreen further heightening the resemblance to “Grand Theft Auto” and similar games. There’s also wall-to-wall, on-the-nose oldies filling in any audio space not occupied by Enis Rotthoff’s thumping techno score.
                                        </br></br>

                                        This is all meant to be a commentary on the rise of dehumanising spectacle in the internet age, but of course the problem is that “Guns” is exactly what it’s satirising. When the alleged satire is as broad and dependent on crass quips as it is here, you very much have a case of pot accusing kettle. An intended joke here is seeing a violent game junkie like Miles thrown into real, messy peril. Yet the action here is often every bit as ludicrously over-the-top as it would be in the fantasy context of any pure popcorn movie. Howden’s prior feature <span>“Deathgasm”</span> was a gory horror comedy that similarly mixed high energy with lowbrow humour to eventually wearying effect. But if its script soon ran out of ideas, that film still had a handmade likability that gets lost in this much more elaborate, impersonal pileup of incessant stunt work and effects.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Providing some point of identification is Radcliffe, an adventuresome talent who throws himself into the role’s physicality, and flexes comic chops whenever he can. But he usually has more discerning choice in vehicles. It’s disappointing to see him turn action hero in a juvenile toy of a movie geared toward viewers whose imaginations were probably more active back when they were reading “Harry Potter.” This part could have been played by any young Hollywood turk, particularly since he and nearly all other principal cast members speak with American accents. (Though shot in Munich and Auckland, the movie is set in a fictional metropolis).
                                        Weaving capably plays not so much a character as a familiar poster image — Hot Chick With Uzi — while Ned Dennehy (much better in a concurrent <span>Toronto Film Festival</span> premiere “Calm With Horses”) is more strenuously uninspired as Ricktor, the chrome-domed, heavily-tattooed main villain. The film’s tech and design personnel all contribute polished work, yet the movie somehow doesn’t feel like it has unifying style so much as a whole lot of every-which-way stimulus. Except, you know, the “thinky” kind.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In a sense, it’s unfair to review “Guns Akimbo” by the usual grownup standards. Just as Christian viewers often complain when secular critics review faith-based entertainment, maybe this film should only be weighed by those who actually want a de facto video game in movie form. For those to whom it will be 97 minutes they don’t spend gaming, and thus attractive both as a break and for being practically the same thing anyway, it may well seem a blast. Howden’s overall sensibility is very much like his approaches to camera and editorial gambits here: So acrobatic that the lack of nearly any content underneath may strike some viewers as no problemo, even beside the point. Is there, in fact, a point? Perhaps movies like this aren’t made for anyone who’d ask that question.

                                            <span>Taika Waititi follows a distinguished tradition with this ‘strange art comedy’ about a boy growing up in Nazi Germany, but fails to cut to the dark heart of the matter.</span>

                                            Since the days of Chaplin’s The Great Dictator, film-makers have adopted naive or comedic perspectives to pierce and deflate the hideous bubble of Nazi ideology – a risky strategy that can reap rich rewards. In the 1967 classic <span>The Producers</span>, Mel Brooks made comedy gold from the spectre of a terrible play celebrating Hitler’s little-known dance skills.</br>
                                            The film won a best screenplay Oscar and spawned a hit stage musical that in turn produced another star-studded screen adaptation. In 1999, Roberto Benigni’s “comedy drama” Life Is Beautiful won three Oscars with its depiction of a man whose comic clowning keeps the horrors of a concentration camp from his son – a premise weirdly reminiscent of Jerry Lewis’s ill-judged <span>The Day the Clown Cried</span>, which was effectively banned by its creator, becoming the subject of ignominious legend.

                                            Now, in this Golden Globe-nominated adaptation of Christine Leunens’s book Caging Skies, New Zealand writer-director-performer Taika Waititi plays a camp, slapstick version of Hitler, who exists in the mind of a German boy, Jojo. Roman Griffin Davis plays the 10-year-old growing up under the Third Reich, whose jolly dreams of becoming an Aryan war hero are thwarted by his innate sensitivity and squeamishness. Nicknamed Jojo Rabbit after failing to strangle a bunny when ordered to do so at a Nazi youth training camp, our antihero promptly blows himself up with a hand grenade, rendering him unfit for future combat. Instead, he’s assigned more menial tasks, including handing out recruitment leaflets, spurred on by visions of his imaginary Führer friend.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Beneath the fanaticism, Jojo is a frightened boy whose sister has died and whose father has disappeared in battle. But his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), has a secret: she’s a covert anti-fascist who is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Leave No Trace star <span>Thomasin McKenzie</span>), in the attic. When Jojo stumbles upon Elsa, he is initially horrified, believing her to be a monster. But gradually the pair strike up a love-hate relationship that infuriates Imaginary Adolf and causes Jojo to start to rethink his allegiances.</br>

                                            From early scenes audaciously intercutting <span>Triumph of the Will</span> footage with the German Beatlemania sounds of Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand (other playfully anachronistic pop tunes include Tom Waits’s I Don’t Wanna Grow Up and David Bowie’s Helden), to later interludes in which Imaginary Adolf acts more like a petulant schoolboy than a murderous dictator, Waititi strives to capture young Jojo’s wide-eyed point of view. There’s a distant echo here of <span>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</span>, another 12-certificate film that looked at the horrors of nazism from the perspective of children. But Mark Herman’s adaptation of John Boyne’s novel had an altogether clearer agenda, leaving the audience in no doubt as to the purpose of the drama.
                                            </br></br>
                                            In a podcast interview that I recorded with Waititi toward the end of 2018, he described Jojo Rabbit (which he was then editing) as a “strange art comedy” that ventured into “dangerous waters”. He also commented that my facial expression while he was describing his forthcoming movie was “kind of confusion, and sort of fear, disgust and doubt; a lot of doubt – which is probably the expression that I have on my face when I talk about it…”
                                            That sense of doubt was not dispelled by the finished film, which, although clearly sincere in its intentions, is neither sharp nor funny enough to cut to the heart of its subject matter. Whereas Waititi’s 2016 gem <span>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</span>
                                             transformed Barry Crump’s novel Wild Pork and Watercress into a note-perfect blend of screen comedy, tragedy and pathos, Jojo Rabbit struggles to achieve the same seamless intertwining of light and dark. It’s not just that the intended interplay between corruption and innocence fails to hit that sweet spot through which great art can transform unspeakable subject matter into something magically accessible; it’s more that the general tone borders all too often on the bland – a fatal flaw.</br>
                                            There are positives.
                                            <span>Sam Rockwell</span> has fun with the role of Captain Klenzendorf, a drunk would-be warrior taken away from the battlefield by the loss of an eye, now apparently resigned to absurd, humiliating defeat; and McKenzie manages to inject a sense of gravitas into the key role of Elsa, even when the script gives her precious little to work with.
                                            </br></br>
                                            I suspect the strangely good-natured feel of the film will win the hearts of many viewers, but my own head remained too muddled by its uneven and oddly indecisive approach to embrace whatever quirky virtues it may possess.

                                        <span>The malign clown … Joaquin Phoenix in Joker  – the most disappointing film of the year.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Why so serious? Todd Phillips’ solemn but shallow supervillain origins movie has a strong performance by Joaquin Phoenix but is weighed down by realist detail and tedious material.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        The year’s biggest disappointment has arrived. It emerges with weirdly grownup self-importance from the tulip fever of festival awards season as an upscale spin on an established pop culture brand. Last year we had Luca Guadagnino’s solemn version of Suspiria, and now it’s Joker, from director and co-writer Todd Phillips: a new origin myth for Batman’s most famous supervillain opponent.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAGVQLHvwOY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a pathetic loser and loner in Gotham City, some time in the early 1980s. Arthur is a former inpatient at a psychiatric facility but is now allowed to live with his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in her scuzzy apartment. Poor Arthur has a neurological condition that means he is liable to break into screeching laughter at inopportune moments. He has a crush on his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and pines to be a comedian, hero-worshipping cheesy TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But he can only get a job as a clown in grinning makeup and floppy-toed shoes twirling an advertising banner outside a store, where he is bullied and beaten up by young thugs passing by. One day, after the humiliation and despair become too much to bear, Arthur gets hold of a gun and discovers that his talent is not for comedy but violence.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Phillips has already directed a film featuring a brilliant unfunny-funny figure with learning difficulties: Alan in The Hangover, played by Zach Galifianakis, that strange dysfunctional figure who mispronounces the noun “retard”. I wonder what Joker would be like with Galifianakis in the lead. Well, the casting of Phoenix indicates more clearly how sexy Joker is supposed to be.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/joker-promo1.jpg" alt="Joker promo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        There is great production design by Mark Friedberg, some tremendous period cityscape images by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and a strong performance by Phoenix, though not his best – it is not as good as his appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master. The film holds your attention up until Joker’s terrible revenge bloodbath on the subway early on, perhaps intended to echo the notorious Bernhard Goetz shooting of 1984 – although Phillips prudently makes it a non-racist attack. After this, the film loses your interest, with tedious and forced material about Joker’s supposed triggering of an anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement with protesters dressing as clowns. Joker’s own criminal and serial-killer career bafflingly fizzles.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The film makes reference to movies from around the drama’s era, such as the Death Wish films, The French Connection and maybe even Star Wars, but it’s more obviously a laborious and pointless homage to the Scorsese/De Niro classic The King of Comedy with a bit of Taxi Driver, which means that at various moments it’s a bit like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, only not as good.</br>
                                        The connection is signalled by the casting of De Niro himself, but it is nonetheless unearned and pedantic, especially compared to Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here, also starring Phoenix as a loner living with his mom, which managed the connection more adroitly.
                                        </br></br>
                                        The whole idea of the malign clown should be very relevant. We live in an era of trolling, incels and internet bullying. (The grisly Milo Yiannopoulos described himself as a “supervillain” on his now cancelled Twitter bio.) There’s nothing wrong and everything right with engaging with all of this – and the “copycat” row is a red herring. But, perhaps because online aggression is difficult to dramatise, Phillips understandably wanted his film to be set in a pre-web age. Yet he cheats an anachronistic quasi-YouTube moment into his story when a video of Arthur’s catastrophic attempt at standup comedy somehow emerges. (I wonder if there wasn’t an earlier, contemporary-set draft of the script.)
                                        ￼</br></br>
                                        This Joker’s genesis is determinedly mature and uncartoony, compared to, say, Jack Nicholson’s low-level crook Jack Napier falling into a chemical vat in Tim Burton’s Batman, turning him into the Joker with white skin, green hair and a rictus grin. (The look of DC’s Joker was originally inspired by Conrad Veidt in the 1928 silent classic The Man Who Laughs, a man whose face was disfigured into a grin by his father’s political enemies.)
                                        </br></br>
                                        There is no reason why Phoenix’s elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn’t be as powerful as Heath Ledger’s mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn’t weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn’t forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.
                                        </br></br>

                                        <span>‘Love and Monsters’: Fun Times During the End Times</span>
                                        </br>
                                        A fun if forgettable family-friendly adventure comedy set in a "monster-pocalypse." Who said the end of the world had to be a downer?
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s the end of the world as Joel (Dylan O’Brien) knows it and, despite living in an underground bunker for seven years to evade the gigantic mutant reptiles, insects and amphibians that now roam the earth’s surface, he feels surprisingly fine. <span>Michael Matthews</span>’ cheerfully PG-13 adventure comedy quickly dispenses with any notional topicality threatened by its premise (it would be a reach to relate the comet-strike/radiation quandary faced by humanity in its opening moments to our current deeply uncool and uncinematic global disaster), but that’s all for the best. It leaves “Love and Monsters” free to get on with its splattery creature effects and silly but satisfying hero’s journey entirely unencumbered by importance.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-19tBHrZwOM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        Abetted by a disarming, charming O’Brien, liberated from the dourness of the last dystopia he battled in the “Maze Runner” movies, Matthews delivers a daffily lightweight throwback to the teen action-adventures of the ’80s and ’90s. Back then, it was more or less routine to summon entire apocalypses into being solely to provide some awkward white American kid with an obstacle course on which to Prove Himself. So when the previously un-kickass Joel splutters triumphantly “I feel like Tom Cruise!” having tossed a grenade into the maw of some slavering beastie, it’s a mark of the film’s benevolent, infectiously simplistic worldview that we can take it at face value. In “Love and Monsters,” love is good, monsters are bad and feeling like Tom Cruise is “awesome.”
                                        </br></br>￼
                                        In a self-deprecating voiceover, Joel brings us up to speed, with the aid of some pencil-drawn animations (he is more talented with colouring pencil than with crossbow). In an effort to deflect an approaching comet, missiles were sent up, which worked fine except the irradiated fragments then dropped down to earth and instantly mutated all cold-blooded creatures — cockroaches, worms, crabs, etc. — into massive, human-hungry monsters. 
                                        </br></br>

                                        Seventeen-year-old Joel was out canoodling with his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) when disaster struck. They got separated, he witnessed his parents’ deaths, and since then he has lived underground as the sole single guy in a colony of loved-up (exclusively heterosexual) couples. Due to his tendency to freeze in the face of danger, Joel’s been left in charge of milking the cow, fixing the radio and cooking the minestrone, while the more vigorous colony members go on perilous overground forays for food and supplies. Charitably, we can infer that this overly protective environment has somewhat arrested his development; the weirdest thing about “Love and Monsters” might just be that Joel is supposedly the ripe old age of 24 while most of it is happening.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Recently, Joel managed to locate Aimee’s colony on the radio, and one day (it’s not very well articulated why now exactly), deaf to the entreaties of his colony “family,” he embarks on the kamikaze 85-mile journey to her coastal enclave. Soon he teams up with an excellent dog named Boy, then he encounters grizzled old-timer Clyde (Michael Rooker) and his precocious 8-year-old sidekick Minnow (an excellent Ariana Greenblatt). They teach him some sterling lessons in survival, as he’s assailed by a Harkonnen-like frog the size of a compact car, a mutant crustacean that would keep Maryland in crab-cakes for a year, nasty underground worm-critters Minnow dubs “Sand Gobblers” and a slow-moving but insatiable final boss monster known as a “Chumbler.”
                                        </br></br>
                                        <span>Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson</span>’s screenplay was apparently written on spec, but the familiar story feels like it was based on pre-existing material. That’s largely due to Matthews’ unapologetic, affectionate appropriation of other films from the post-apocalyptic and coming-of-age genres, the sum total of which represent a kind of smorgasbord of what “Love and Monsters” is going for. Joel and Boy are reminiscent of the equivalent “iconic duo” (as Joel dubs them) from “I Am Legend,” and even the dog’s name seems a winking reference to 1975’s “A Boy and His Dog,” a far nastier, grimier tale of a human-canine pair traversing a mutant-infested wasteland on a much less wholesome quest for female companionship. 
                                        When Joel teams up with Clyde and Minnow, the film briefly becomes “Zombieland.” The subterranean monsters inevitably recall “Tremors.” And when Joel encounters a working MAV1S (a helper robot that feels like a subplot that got curtailed in the final pass) and it plays Ben E. King’s “Stand by Me,” sure enough, just a few scenes later, echoing Rob Reiner’s touchstone film of the same name, Joel emerges from a river covered in leeches — though these are of the fist-sized poisonously psychedelic kind.
                                        </br></br>￼
                                        The creature design team obviously had a good time. It’s a relief to encounter such varied and pleasingly lo-fi monsters in an age when everything else seems to be a riff on the “Cloverfield” thingamajig. And as slimy, toothy and gross as the creatures often are, Lachlan Milne’s sprightly photography and Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp’s scrupulously generic “let’s go on an adventure!” score never allow for things to get too dark. It’s all quite forgettable, but in the moment so goodnatured that even the hopeful little “Hi! We could do a sequel!” hooks carefully planted throughout can’t spoil the fun. In fact, a sequel seems quite an appealing prospect, if we can just, as a civilisation, make it our noble, quixotic mission to survive that long.
                                        </br></br>￼

                                        <span>‘Soul’: From the Minds Behind ‘Inside Out’ Comes an Even Deeper Look at What Makes People Tick.</span></br>
                                        Pixar gives audiences a fresh way to think about the dimension that defines their personality, while broadening its cultural horizons to feature the studio's first predominantly Black cast.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Where do people get their personalities? Do parents play a part, or are such things somehow determined before birth? For centuries, doctors of psychology, doctors of philosophy and doctors of theology have contributed their thoughts on the subject, but the latest breakthrough comes from another kind of doctor entirely: <span>Pete Docter</span>, the big-idea <span>Pixar</span> brain behind outside-the-box toons “Inside Out” and “Up,” who takes a look deep inside and comes up with another intuitive, easy-to-embrace metaphor for — dare I say it — the meaning of life.
                                        The result is “Soul,” a whimsical, musical and boldly metaphysical dramedy about what makes each and everybody tick, featuring a cast of characters who don’t have bodies at all. “Soul” opens with the death of its down-on-his-luck hero, middle school band teacher Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), a frustrated pianist who aces a jazz band audition, then steps out into the street, where he narrowly avoids being smushed by construction workers and crushed by an oncoming car, only to fall through a manhole to his untimely end.
                                        </br></br>
                                        <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/soul-promo1.jpg" alt="Soul promo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                        This is not at all where one expects a kids movie to begin. Not even “Bambi” went so far as to kill its main character before the opening credits. But then, “Soul” plays hardly anything by the rules. Frankly, this may not be a kids movie at all, although releasing directly to Disney Plus subscription service on Dec. 25 (amid COVID-19’s second wave) suggests the studio is treating it as such. Joe’s death isn’t scary, but it asks young audiences to acknowledge the issue of mortality in a way that few films dare. And then, it proceeds to bend — although “shape” might be a more accurate word — their understanding of what happens before and after people’s lives on Earth.
                                        Just before he bites the dust, Joe lands his big break, earning a shot to play with jazz legend Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett) at the Half Note club. Nearly all his life, Joe has wanted nothing more than to be a musician. He’s good, too, given the improvisations we’re privy to here — in class, in rehearsal and later, in the solitude of his own apartment. So it’s not surprising that he might be alarmed to find himself on a conveyor belt through the Great Beyond, the void-like zone Docter and production designer Steve Pilcher have imagined late souls enter just before they are zapped into oblivion.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Again, this sequence could have been intimidating for young viewers — or old ones, for that matter — though the movie treats it lightly, allowing Joe (who’s the only soul with second thoughts about the afterlife) to fall off the escalator and plunge through several dimensions to the Great Before, a more Elysian Fields-ian place with lilac skies and periwinkle grass where giggly, vaguely Casper the Friendly Ghost-like souls are prepped for Earth.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It’s an awe-inspiring answer to an impossible challenge: How to animate the not-yet-animate? But this is a Pixar movie, so it’s no surprise that the team opts to cutesify the abstract idea of a pre-corporeal self, giving each soul googly eyes and a pure glow. What we see are adorable amorphous blobs with trippy chromatic aberration around the edges — colour fringing that suggests the virtual lenses can barely capture their elusive luminosity (and the opposite of old-school animation, where characters were “contained” by thick black lines).
                                        </br></br>
                                        There are rules for this realm, which recall the ingenious way Docter translated the notion of human emotion into clean cartoon terms with “Inside Out.” Nascent souls appear here and are guided along by mentors — those who have already lived and seem keen to pass their passions along to the next generation. Once new souls discover their “spark,” they’re given an entry pass to Earth, where they’re presumably assigned to an infant body. (It’s a far more sophisticated explanation of where babies come from than the delivery storks of “Dumbo” — or Pixar’s own “Partly Cloudy” short).
                                        </br></br>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOsLIiBStEs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                        That’s where Docter’s groundbreaking theory of where people get their personalities factors in: Some components are imprinted at the “You Seminar” (another, more corporate-sounding name for the Great Before), and others are discovered with a little helpful guidance from the older souls. The model isn’t perfect, but there’s a certain brilliance in encouraging kids to identify what excites them in life. One can imagine “Soul” leading to early “eureka” moments in some viewers. Still, the film seems better suited to adult audiences, the way Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life” or Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” resonates differently with a little life experience.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Joe wants to get back to the body that (we learn) is still hooked up to life support. But he’s mistaken for a mentor and randomly assigned to a “soul mate,” No. 22 (Tina Fey), a misfit who’s been around for ages and who seems perfectly content never to “get a life.” In fact, 22 prefers it in the Great Before, where countless, more accomplished mentors than Joe — from Abraham Lincoln to Mother Theresa — have tried (and failed) to find her spark. But the overseers — a trio of classic UPA-style line drawings (Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade and Wes Studi), each named Jerry — are easygoing enough to let these two give it a go, and before long, they find a loophole that lands them both on earth.
                                        </br></br>
                                        
                                        It’s going to be hard for “Soul” audiences to keep this next twist a secret, but for the sake of the review, let it be a surprise how the pair manifest on earth. Joe’s desperate to get back to that jazz club, while 22 would give anything not to be dragged along on his single-minded — and clearly selfish — mission to make his jazz dreams come true. (She far prefers her comfortable nonexistence to the assault of overwhelming noises and smells of New York City.) But now that she is alive, 22 starts to realise that it’s not as bad as she imagined.
                                        </br></br>
                                        That’s not a message kids need to hear, though there is surely no shortage of adults out there who wish they’d “never been born at all,” and “Soul” has the generous, big-hearted quality of so many Pixar movies before it that makes even a mediocre life seem like something to be appreciated. Docter and co-writers Mike Jones and Kemp Powers (the latter also co-directed) have filled the back half of the film with scenes that uplift and set receptive souls a-tingling.
                                        </br></br>
                                        First, there’s the barbershop, where Joe comes to realise that his obsession with music has interfered with his ability to make meaningful friendships. There’s the face-to-face with tough-love mom Libba (Phylicia Rashad) that puts some of his parental issues in perspective. And there’s the truly magical moment when Joe sits down at his piano and just starts playing, drifting off into what the movie refers to as “The Zone.” As the sage and slightly kooky-sounding British talkshow host Graham Norton puts it, in character as a mystic named Moonwind, “When joy becomes an obsession, one becomes disconnected from life”.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Of all the movie’s gambles — those big risks that might have caused this dazzling house of cards to collapse upon itself — the most unexpected is Pixar vet Docter telling fellow adults that there’s such a thing as being too focused on one’s dreams. Here’s a lesson coming from a studio where artists notoriously sacrifice their private lives to fulfill their passions, where long hours and absolute focus are expected of their employees. And then Docter goes and pushes his luck one step further with a life lesson hardly any family movie dares acknowledge: Sometimes, achieving your dream can leave you feeling emptier than you did before.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Like it or not, that’s a truth worth telling — a sincere, dark-night-of-the-“Soul” revelation —and one that feels far more radical than the long-overdue decision to center this film on a predominantly Black cast. Pixar’s been way behind the diversity curve for far too long: From its inception, the company has been a boys club in which the core team of (bright) white guys have taken turns directing movies about white characters: white toys, white fish, white cars, white ideas. They’ve made room to mentor, but have been slow to diversify their characters and stories onscreen.
                                        </br></br>
                                        And now this. It will be up to audiences of color to decide whether this exceptional film satisfies Pixar’s long void of near total non-representation. “Coco” was a start, though this feels like a breakthrough: a cartoon where the hero could be any race, and his creators opted to project their imaginations beyond the mirror. And though it’s almost impossible to reverse-engineer who did what in a co-directing situation, one has to imagine that some of the film’s cultural perspective owes to co-director Powers (whose play, “One Night in Miami,” also reaches screen this fall). Judging by Mr. Mittens, the movie’s feline sidekick, the crew was light on cat lovers.
                                        </br></br>
                                        In any case, the unsung hero here — the heart of “Soul,” if you will — can be found in the music. From Betty Boop to the Pink Panther, jazz has shaped and inspired the medium of animation (especially in its more avant garde experiments). Pixar rekindles that connection, enlisting Jon Batiste to create the jazz portion of the score — from the fleet-fingered, Keith Jarrett-like improvisations Joe performs to the vibe of city life itself — while Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered the New Agey sound of the before- and after-life.
                                        </br></br>
                                        It all blends together beautifully, a marriage of Pixar’s square, safe, feel-good sensibility with what could be described as the “real world” — and one that, much as “Inside Out” anthropomorphised the mind, will leave audiences young and old imagining their own souls as glowing idiosyncratic cartoon characters. And that’s just what the Docter ordered.
                                        </br></br>

                                            <span>“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is dazzling, hilarious, and unique”.</span>
                                            </br></br>
                                            It’s the beginning of its own interconnected animated universe.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Back in 2013, <span>Sony Pictures Entertainment</span> announced plans for its own elaborate, interconnected universe based around Spider-Man. Among the planned titles: <span>Amazing Spider-Man 3 </span>(which never happened), <span>Venom</span> (which arguably shouldn’t have happened), and <span>The Sinister Six</span> (which hasn’t happened yet, though writer-director Drew Goddard would still love to tackle it). Instead, Sony went a different way, partnering with <span>Marvel</span> two years later to make Spider-Man part of the <span>Marvel Cinematic Universe</span>, leading to Tom Holland’s portrayal of Peter Parker in <span>Spider-Man: Homecoming</span>and other MCU films.
                                            </br></br>
                                            It was a concession that perhaps Marvel Studios knew how to best handle the marquee version of the character. But in spite of Spider-Man’s successful MCU integration, Sony continued to work on many of its expanded universe ideas. The most intriguing of the bunch was <span>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</span>, an animated film meant not only to step away from the world of live-action superheroes, but to put the spotlight on Miles Morales, the character writer Brian Michael Bendis created in 2011 to take over the mantle of Spider-Man after Peter Parker was killed. With the project being creatively shepherded by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the duo behind The Lego Movie and the 21 Jump Street films, the project had the potential to offer a fresh, radically different take on the character that would actually warrant a standalone film in a sea of interconnected franchise titles.
                                            </br></br>

                                            The finished film is all those things and more. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a raucous, smart, self-referential adventure. The comics-inspired visuals are stunning, and the emotional coming-of-age story is relevant and inspiring, even as it acknowledges the many Spider-Man movies that have come before it. Sony is clearly looking for a way to launch its own distinct take on Spider-Man that can stand up to the live-action MCU version, and that franchise now has its first instalment.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Unpacking the storyline in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a bit tricky because the film is so fast-paced and filled with so many meta-references that it becomes a bit of an interconnected puzzle. It starts off with Peter Parker (Chris Pine) trying to dismantle a massive supercollider built by the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber). Spider-Man is killed in the battle, leading all of New York to mourn the loss of their hometown superhero. Then the film shifts to teenager Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), whose artistic inclinations don’t necessarily please his police officer father (Brian Tyree Henry). One night, Miles’ uncle Aaron (<span>Mahershala Ali</span> from Moonlight and the recent Green Book) takes him to a hidden tunnel in the subway system to spray-paint a mural, and Miles is bitten by a mysterious spider. Soon, he’s developing Spider-Man-esque powers.
                                            </br></br>
                                            That’s just the beginning of a story that pulls different iterations of Spider-Man from alternative universes into Miles’ own. A flailing, middle-aged Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), the black-and-white Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), and Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) are just a few examples of the larger Spider-Man metaverse that Miles learns exists. Soon, they join forces to stop Kingpin so Miles can harness his emerging powers, and so the other characters can use the machine to jump back to their own dimensions before it’s too late.
                                            </br></br>
                                            For a film with such a mind-bending premise, Into the Spider-Verse is remarkably efficient in the way it sets up the various characters and the world’s stakes, largely by relying on the audience’s knowledge of comic book movies and these characters. An opening montage, for example, tells the backstory of the soon-to-be-deceased Peter Parker, which essentially establishes him as the <span>Tobey Maguire</span> iteration of the character from the Sam Raimi film trilogy. The upside-down kiss with Mary Jane from Raimi’s 2002 original, the train rescue from Spider-Man 2, and the regrettable Spider-Man 3 dance sequence are all referenced, and when he dies, it serves as a clean break from all other iterations of the character.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4Hbz2jLxvQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                            The knowing meta-humor present in that opening montage never relents. The script from Lord and co-director Rodney Rothman is filled with the kind of irreverent takes on pop culture and movie tropes that pepper Lord and Miller’s own films. And with each of the different multiverse characters embodying their own genres, there are plenty of different gags to play with. Cage’s Spider-Man Noir is a parody of goofy film noir clichés. The storyline of the anime-influenced Peni Parker is remarkably earnest, yet winking in the way it utilizes that particular animation style. The talking pig Spider-Ham (yes, a real Marvel character, voiced by John Mulaney) serves as broad comic relief, with the sheer absurdity of the character allowing the others — as heightened and bizarre as they may be in their own right — to feel relatively grounded by comparison.
                                            </br></br>
                                            That balance is essential because while this is an animated film, Miles Morales is one of the most relatable, vulnerable lead characters to appear in a Spider-Man movie. His desire to establish his own identity separate from his father’s, his awkward teenage clumsiness when he meets someone he likes in school, and his frustration that he can’t easily master his newfound skills with ease all create a storyline that echoes the struggles of any teenager battling to discover and establish their identity. These are themes present in most Spider-Man origin stories, but setting them against the backdrop of the multiverse — which allows Miles to learn that there are multiple interpretations of what he can be as Spider-Man, all of them valid — brings the point home further.
                                            </br></br>
                                            It also underscores the importance of this film choosing to focus on Morales in the first place. In movies, the Spider-Man franchise has for far too long focused on the same character doing the same things, often in the exact same way, no matter what strides the comic made in terms of diversity and representation. Into the Spider-Verse shows what a wasted opportunity that has been. In this film, Spider-Man isn’t one particular person; it’s an idea accessible to anyone, no matter where they come from or what they look like. And it’s almost certainly no accident that the older multiverse Peter Parker who Miles teams up with — an out-of-shape, middle-aged white dude who’s totally screwed up his own life, in spite of all the built-in advantages of being a superhero — ends up learning quite a bit from Morales about how to repair his own life and respect other people.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Along with the story insights and laughs, however, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is undeniably a visual powerhouse, with a style unlike any previous comics adaptation. The film pulls both from traditional 3D computer animation and comic book aesthetics, mashing them up into a dazzling, kinetic style. In one moment, the film lays out multiple panels on the screen. In another, it uses written captions to mirror Miles’ internal monologue. In yet another, it deploys familiar written sound effects to match the action. It allows the directing team — Rothman, Bob Persichetti, and Peter Ramsey — to litter every frame with as many flourishes and blink-and-miss-it gags as possible. (My personal favorite is when the word “Bagel!” is used as a sound effect. Trust me on this one).
                                            </br></br>
                                            Sometimes the film does reach visual overload. In the final act, particularly, so much is happening on-screen that the movie’s style seems to undercut the narrative, turning everything into a blur of shape, color, and movement. But for the most part, the highly experimental style works extraordinarily well. It’s a testament to Sony that the studio was willing to let the filmmakers go so far with the visual treatment, and it becomes one more element that distinguishes Spider-Verse as something completely distinct from other Spider-Man movies or even other animated films.
                                            </br></br>
                                            That last aspect — the fact that it feels honestly, truly unique — is one of the most invigorating aspects of Into the Spider-Verse. Superhero movies clutter the cinematic landscape these days, and with rare exceptions like Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther they often look, sound, and act alike. They’ve become more consumer-friendly products than storytelling endeavors, with specific moments and stylistic approaches that are carefully honed to create films with the greatest possible chance of success. That doesn’t mean they’re all good (as many of Sony’s Spider-Man releases prove), but it does mean that they’re safe and often extraordinarily similar.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is incredibly exciting because it eschews all of that. It’s innovative, irreverent, and dynamic. It’s hilarious but exceptionally earnest, with a lead character worth caring about. It’s the kind of cinematic ride that invites more franchise installments — not just to learn more about the many, many characters it introduces and worlds it hints at, but just to see how Miles Morales’ Spider-Man will grow and change.
                                            </br></br>
                                            If Sony really wants to find a way to separate itself from Marvel, DC, and every other comic book adaptation out there, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to jettison its upcoming live-action Spider-Man spinoffs and just work on expanding the Miles Morales Spider-Verse. The framework is already there, as are a multitude of new characters embodying different takes and new points of view. That’s no doubt why the studio has already quietly started development on a sequel, as well as a Spider-Women movie that will focus on Gwen Stacey and other female heroes. There have been a lot of Spider-Man movies over the last 16 years, but Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is unique in a way none of the others can match.

                                            <span>Gory Trump-baiting satire is more hype than horror : The delayed liberal elites vs rural ‘deplorables’ thriller isn’t quite the political hot potato it’s being sold as, offering boilerplate B-movie schlock instead.</span>

                                            How do you solve a problem like reviewing The Hunt? The schlocky horror film would ordinarily garner little attention beyond genre fans and a handful of critics. But after months of buildup touting it as a satire about liberal elites hunting rural Trump voters, the film now comes with some baggage.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoWmwsPU5cQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                            <span>The Hunt</span>, directed by <span>Craig Zobel</span> and written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof, appears at first glance to purposely provoke – one character references “the rat-fucker-in-chief”, another talks of “slaughtering a dozen deplorables” (a reference to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” remark). The context of this line becaomes clear when the plot gets going: 12 people wake up, gagged and confused, in the woods while a mysterious box sits nearby, filled with weapons. (The script is loosely inspired by Richard Connell’s 1924 short story The Most Dangerous Game, about a rich man who hunts other humans for sport.) It doesn’t take long for every variety of death – shooting, exploding, stabbing – to descend from a hidden and prepared upper class.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/the-hunt-promo1.jpg" alt="The Hunt promo" class="feature-one-promo"> 
                                            The violence is gratuitous if cartoonish – one woman is shot at, impaled and then blown in half. But The Hunt does play with who to root for and who, if anyone, you can trust. Deaths are often swift and occasionally surprising; the characters are one-line stereotypes – rural woman from Wyoming, white wannabe rapper from Florida, Staten Islander who loves guns (Ike Barinholtz), Ivanka fan in leggings (Emma Roberts) – and are picked off one by one. The only “deplorable” with a clue how to fight back is Crystal (Betty Gilpin), a mysterious woman with an even more mysterious knowledge of martial arts.
                                            </br></br>
                                            The Hunt’s release in the middle of coronavirus fears in the US is another unlucky development in the film’s rollout. It was originally slated for release last September, but mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, prompted a postponement. Soon after, details about the film emerged and rightwing anger followed, even from Trump himself.
                                            </br></br>
                                            In February, it returned with an updated marketing strategy riffing on the controversy. A more spoiler-heavy trailer meant to frame the concept as a joke featured the tagline: “The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one’s actually seen.” The film-makers have claimed they didn’t anticipate any controversy from a film pitting “liberal elites” against “deplorables” in a violent human hunt, which seems like lobbing a mock grenade into a minefield and getting upset when people scatter.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Nevertheless, they have something of a point: if you can set aside the noise, you’re left with a boilerplate B-movie that doesn’t say nearly as much as it thinks it does. The jokes are the words of stereotypes spoken with a straight face, an opportunity to have a character say “climate change is real”, poke fun at white liberal NPR listeners who debate using “black” v “African-American” (“White people – we’re the worst,” says one elite in reference to everything except his killing), and imbue “did you read that article?” with more menace.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Which isn’t to say it completely lacks redeeming qualities, namely Gilpin. It’s good fun to watch her slink into a bunker and spit, “Bye, bitch,” or drawl through a rendition of The Tortoise and the Hare that ends in more violence. She bounces back from various injury in a matter of seconds and has a genuinely entertaining one-on-one fight with Hilary Swank, as chief elite villain.
                                            </br></br>
                                            The rest of the satire, however, struggles to translate. In creating characters that embody the worst stereotypes of America’s political poles, and making America’s divide as literal and violent as possible, The Hunt feigns a viewpoint rather than actually putting one forward. It takes aim at everyone, redeeming no one. Which feels circular, and queasy, and takes us right back where we started: some empty talk about a divided nation, and a film not worthy of this much conversation.

                                        <span>Is ‘The New Mutants’ The Worst ‘X-Men’ Movie Ever?</span>
                                        <span>Fox (and now Disney’s) groundbreaking (if inconsistent) X-Men franchise deserved a better send-off than this nothing-burger of a movie.</span>
                                        </br></br>
                                        Note: I’m not going to lecture you about attending movie theaters, since we’re all adults. But I will note that I saw this at a drive-in late last night, and that Disney is reporting that the film earned $750,000 in preview screenings. Even noting 62% nationwide capacity, that still would have been around $1.25 million in preview grosses in 100% of the country which (using plausible comparisons) would have been an opening of between $13 million and $21 million for the weekend. At the moment, we might expect a $7 million-$13 million Fri-Sun debut.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Putting aside the circumstances of its release, both in terms of being delayed for over two years (mostly due to shenanigans related to Disney DIS +0.5% buying Fox in mid-2019) and being the first “major” studio release dropped into nationwide theatrical release after months pandemic-related theater closures, The New Mutants is a miserable motion picture. It’s a monotonous, redundant and irrelevant fantasy flick that fails to commit to being a teen melodrama, a YA fantasy or a horror movie, instead offering half-assed components of all three. Despite a strong cast, the all-too-rare presence of an LGBTQIA romance between two lead characters and a few moments of visual inventiveness, Josh Boone and Knate Lee’s The New Mutants boils down to being, yes, a terrible feature-length prequel for a sequel that absolutely no one will ever want to see.
                                        </br></br>

                                        The film concerns five teens who reside in an abandoned hospital run by Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga). Long-story short, they are all mutants with unusually dangerous powers who have unintentional (or, in one case, righteously intentional) blood on their hands and are under supervision until they learn to control their powers. Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) enters the fray after her entire reservation is wiped off the map in the film’s cryptic prologue, and even though she doesn’t yet know what her mutant power is she is considered a danger to others. As Dani struggles to figure out what she can or can’t do, while romantically bonding with persecuted lycan Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams), the teens begin to experience terrifying visions linked to their own respective traumas. But all is not as it seems.

                                        The film does indeed take place within the world of Fox’s X-Men series, although that franchise’s random continuity negates much interconnectivity. There’s, at best, a few verbal references to the X-Men and a fleeting non-verbal reference to Charles Xavier, a character who either still runs the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters (X-Men: Days of Future Past) or left the school to Hank McCoy after his attempts to control Jean Grey went awry (Dark Phoenix). Regardless, these aren’t exactly flagship characters, and nobody wears anything resembling a comic book costume, so the film has to stand on its own as a spin-off that just happens to take place in an existing universe. While the film could be commended for being a full-throated genre approximation, it still plays out as expected in terms of comic book superhero expectations.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Due to obvious franchise aspirations, we have five primary characters who all get introductions, sequences where they show off their powers, scenes where they lay out their respective traumatic “origin story” and set-pieces where they fend off haunted visions. Yes, that’s a lot of leg work for a 90-minute movie. The monotony and redundancy resembles It, which also spent much of its running time with somewhat stand-alone sequences of its unkillable main cast being attacked by specifically-tailored terrors. That film at least had more than just stand-alone scare sequences and didn’t entirely take place in a single visually drab interior locale. Considering Fox allegedly first demanded reshoots after It made $700 million worldwide, it’s ironic that New Mutants (essentially what Boone shot in 2017) has all of It’s weakness and none of its strengths.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Anya Taylor-Joy makes for a compelling Illyana Rasputin, presented as a victim of child slavery (and presumably rape) and she cuts a striking action figure in the film’s fantastical climax. None of the other kids (including Henry Zaga’s Roberto da Costa and Charlie Heaton’s Sam Guthrie), all of whom have done fine work elsewhere, make an impression. Braga barely allows her voice to rise above a whisper. Save for fleeting past-tense cameos, those six people are the only characters in the movie. The 90-minute flick consists of these five youngsters going through a standard TV pilot-style heroic awakening with the presumption that they’ll be the marquee characters/heroes fans wanted to see in the next movie. Considering Dark Phoenix’s failure and Disney’s presumed intent to reboot X-Men into the existing MCU, this route is especially cruel.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Lacking marquee characters and existing as a feature-length prologue, The New Mutants fails as a teen melodrama and, partially because we know none of the core cast is in any danger, as a horror movie. Whether it justifies itself as an X-Men movie is irrelevant since it is a very bad X-Men movie, the worst of the franchise. At least X-Men Origins: Wolverine had multiple locations, multiple characters and big-scale comic book action that resembled a trashy 1980’s Cannon flick. New Mutants’ visuals are generally drab, and the few moments of fantastical color lit up the screen. All due credit for an inclusive cast and a front-and-center same-sex romance, and with a note that Boone’s The Fault in Our Stars was one of the best movies of 2014, The New Mutants is like watching a lousy TV pilot for a show that you know didn’t get picked up.

                                            <span>After the must-see showdown that was 'Infinity War,' the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span>
                                            </br></br>
                                            The culmination of 10 years and more than twice as many movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Avengers: Endgame” promises closure where its predecessor, “Avengers: Infinity War,” sowed chaos. That film — which revealed that the cookie-cutter uniformity of all those MCU movies had been part of an unprecedented master plan — infamously wrapped with a snap: a gesture that, when performed by a supervillain armed with the six Infinity Stones, was capable of wiping out half of all life in the universe.</br>
                                            Audiences have had a year to mourn the loss of Spider-Man, Star-Lord, and Black Panther (whom they’d only just met two months earlier), and to nurture theories as to where directing siblings Anthony and Joe Russo might steer things from here. Maybe all those characters weren’t really dead. Maybe the remaining Avengers just needed to travel inside the Soul Stone to get them back. Or maybe “Avengers: Endgame” would have to resort to that most desperate of narrative cheats — time travel — to undo the damage caused by Thanos (the purple-skinned, multi-chinned baddie so compellingly performed by Josh Brolin).
                                            </br></br>
                                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcMBFSGVi1c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video-1"></iframe>
                                            The element of surprise and the thrill of discovery are everything in these movies, so every attempt has been made to minimize spoilers. Yes, “Avengers: Endgame” is the most expansive film yet, and yes, it strives to provide emotional catharsis for several of fans’ favorite characters. It’s even safe to say that “Endgame” shifts the focus from extravagant, effects-driven displays of universe-saving — manifold though they remain — to the more human cost of heroism, which comes at great personal sacrifice.</br>
                                            That said, readers should also be warned that “Avengers: Endgame” hinges on the most frustrating of narrative tricks, and that no meaningful analysis of the film can take place without delving into some of the choices made by the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. If “Infinity War” was billed as a must-see event for all moviegoers, whether or not they’d attended a single Marvel movie prior, then “Endgame” is the ultimate fan-service follow-up, so densely packed with pay-offs to relationships established in the previous films that it all but demands that audiences put in the homework of watching (or rewatching) a dozen earlier movies to appreciate the sense of closure it offers the series’ most popular characters.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/avengers-endgame-promo1.jpeg" alt="Avengers Endgame promo" class="feature-two-promo">
                                            To the extent that it has all been leading up to this, no franchise in Hollywood history can rival what the Disney-Marvel alliance has wrought, although “Avengers” would not be what it is without the three-films-over-three-years scope of Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, the coming-of-age continuity of Warner Bros.’ eight-part Harry Potter saga, or the 21st-century shift of serialized television to expansive, ensemble-driven narrative. Each of those experiments in cumulative, multi-part storytelling served to test just how far audiences would go to follow characters they love over time. But nothing — not the horror of Han Solo frozen in carbonite, nor the shock of James Bond’s wife murdered at the end of “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” — could prepare fans for the Snap, and the pain of watching half the heroes they’d gotten to know turned to dust at the end of “Avengers: Infinity War.”
                                            </br></br>
                                            The opening scene of “Endgame” revisits that unbearable moment from the point of view of Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who sat out the previous battle to spend time with his wife and kids, such that the agony he feels in watching them vaporized by the Snap will come to stand for what all living things must experience as they witness their friends and family disappear.</br>
                                            Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., looking frail) and Thanos’ daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan), now begrudgingly “good,” are drifting somewhere out in space when they encounter Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) hovering outside their cockpit. That’s not quite how a “Captain Marvel” end-credits vignette teased her joining the Avengers — which involved a pager signal sent by her human ally, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) — but “Endgame” has so much ground to cover in the span of three hours that it breezes past introductions and treats her arrival as a fait accompli, racing to its first confrontation with Thanos, who has banished himself to a remote garden planet with his gauntlet.</br>
                                            That showdown doesn’t go at all as audiences might expect, but establishes that whoever holds those six all-powerful Infinity Stones can achieve pretty much whatever they want simply by snapping their fingers — with one major problem: Thanos has destroyed the stones. That means the universe is stuck like this unless someone invents time travel.
                                            </br></br>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/film/promo/avengers-endgame-promo2.jpg" alt="Avengers Endgame promo" class="feature-one-promo">
                                            Spoiler alert: Someone invents time travel — which feels like a skill so far beyond the reach of modern science that maybe it should’ve qualified as a superpower and, if memory serves, might even have been among Doctor Strange’s abilities, except that the super-wizard (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) was one of the casualties of “Infinity War.” Before surrendering his Infinity Stone, Doctor Strange projected himself forward in time to view all possible outcomes of the Avengers’ uphill battle, reporting back that of those 14,000,605 alternate futures, only one resulted in victory over Thanos.</br>
                                            “Infinity War” may have gone badly for the Avengers, but the odds are pretty good that “Endgame” will yield that one possible happy ending, even if it means permanently having to say goodbye to certain characters — or at least, to certain actors in those roles, as we have already seen creative reboots of Spider-Man, Hulk, and the X-Men at other studios. And now that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has demonstrated the potential for time travel at the quantum realm — a solution teased over the end credits of his last outing — the Avengers are free to buddy up and jump through time to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos can get to them, at which point they can make their own gauntlet and snap things in and out of existence.
                                            </br></br>
                                            The Russo brothers dedicate an inordinate amount of time to convincing the heroes that the mission is worth trying, which may have worked in “The Magnificent Seven” but asks us to accept that, after shoving two or three of these Marvel movies down our throats a year, somehow everyone has sat idle for half a decade, crushed by depression and defeat. Still, the five-year flash-forward — a trick borrowed from the “Battlestar Galactica” playbook — allows for significant, and in some cases amusing, changes to Iron Man, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, who’d had trouble transforming when last we saw him), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth, still plenty sarcastic but looking the most different).</br>
                                            But here’s the thing about using time travel to solve their problems: As soon as screenwriters open the door to that device, then any sequel can undo whatever came before. Here, War Machine (Don Cheadle) makes the suggestion that they go back and strangle Thanos in the crib, which the film treats as a joke, and yet, it sounds like a better idea than the “time heist” they have in store. Alternately, they could wait for Thanos to hijack all six Infinity Stones and then jump in and prevent him from using them.
                                            </br></br>
                                            Frankly, there are 14 million better ideas out there, but this one is designed to yield the maximum number of surprising twists, amusing confrontations, and bromance-y bonding moments between mismatched partners (like Thor and the Bradley Cooper-voiced space raccoon Rocket). The plan also allows the surviving Avengers to revisit scenes from the earlier films, watching their younger versions — as well as fallen comrades — from another angle, and in two very different cases, facing off against his or her past self.</br>
                                            To the film’s credit, it’s not the casualties, but the chances these heroes have to go back and say things to those they’ve lost that resonate as the most emotional scenes in “Endgame”: Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America (Chris Evans) each get such opportunities, any one of which would’ve been worth the price of admission. Still, all that time travel creates a host of paradoxes that will keep the geek debates raging for years: What happens if your “former future” kills an earlier, alternate version of yourself? If every change creates a “branch reality,” what kind of outcomes are in store for the universe in all those new paths? And why, if one has all six Infinity Stones in his possession, is snapping even required to set one’s wishes in motion?
                                            </br></br>
                                            By this point in the franchise, audiences have come to expect a top-of-the-line experience: iconic costumes and sets, stunning visual effects (including convincing computer-generated characters, like Thanos and Hulk), cinematography that alternates smoothly between epic clashes and nuanced character moments, and rousing music that underscores both the peril and the sheer importance of it all. Like “Infinity War” before it, “Endgame” delivers these elements at a higher level than Marvel’s less expensive — and considerably less expansive — lone-hero installments. But there’s something considerably less elegant to the storytelling this time around.</br>
                                            If “Infinity War” built inexorably to an “inevitable” conclusion (as Thanos arrogantly describes his victory), that was made possible by the filmmakers’ daring choice of positioning their villain as a deeply unconventional protagonist: It was Thanos who undertook the “hero’s journey” of that film, wildly outnumbered by the Avengers in his quest to amass the Infinity Stones. Here, the equation is reversed, with a surfeit of heroes now splitting up to repeat more or less the same mission, with only one adversary to oppose them (even with the Avengers’ ranks reduced by half, there are still too many to keep straight, while the prospect of reviving any of the fallen only makes it more unmanageable).
                                            </br></br>
                                            It works because the creative team has taken note of what audiences want (Black Panther! Captain Marvel!) and what the culture at large is asking for (more diverse representation all around), crafting brief but impactful moments along the way. If these Avengers movies are like massive symphonies, then the conductors have taken care to give nearly everyone a standout solo, however short — or, in the minute that played best at the film’s premiere, a group shot that gathers all the female Avengers, and proves that had Thanos’ snap wiped out just the dudes, the remaining women would’ve been awfully formidable on their own. However satisfying — and necessary — these vignettes may be, is it still art when a movie seems so transparently reverse-engineered according to audiences’ appetites, or does that make “Endgame” the ultimate pop-culture confection?
                                            </br></br>
                                            After nearly two and a half hours of hardcore comic-book entertainment — alternating earnest storytelling with self-deprecating zingers designed to show that Marvel doesn’t take itself too seriously — “Endgame” wraps all that logic-bending nonsense with a series of powerful emotional scenes. Whereas all the casualties suffered at the end of “Infinity War” felt suspiciously like a gimmick that would be undone in this film, these meaty character moments illustrate the spirit of personal sacrifice certain individuals consciously make on behalf of the team, and the universe at large.</br>
                                            Time and again, “Endgame” makes the point that family matters, whether that means biological ties — as Iron Man, Hawkeye, Ant Man, and Thor have experienced — or those forged by duty. The final takeaway from this decade-long journey is that heroism isn’t defined by bravery or super-abilities, but by what one gives up for the greater good. Among the many frustrations of the Snap was that it robbed so many great characters — and gazillions of anonymous creatures throughout the galaxy — of proactively making that choice. “Endgame” isn’t exactly a do-over, but it builds to an infinitely more satisfying conclusion.
                                            </br></br>
